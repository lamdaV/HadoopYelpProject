I would give 5 stars but the hipster staff looks exactly like the hipster guests and I can tell which hipster to ask for services from. I may be being harsh but I personally find it one star worth of annoying. They should at least have some sort of hipster dress code where all the hipsters look like working hipsters instead of guest hipsters.
Absolute blast!!! Try the pretzel bites with fondue, they're amazing. Also their burgers are great. Drinks are a little pricey, but great. Also, they have games(ping pong, corn hole, etc.) Definitely a fun hangout with friends.
One of my favorite places in phoenix. the food is always good, the service is unfortunately always slow, but the food, like I said, GOOD!
Loved it! great atmosphere and the food was decent, the drinks were fabulous!
Great Hipster place!!! Meaning:
My wife and I met her cousin and his wife for lunch on Saturday, January 9, 2016.  This was a very neat place!  There was indoor seating, but we decided to sit "outside" in a patio area.  The area was covered overhead, but was open air.  The outside temperature was very cool and the area that we sat in was equipped with over heaters as well as fire pits.
This place was so amazing! The food is to dye for!
Food, service and ping pong were awesome! My hub had the meatloaf; thumbs up there. I had the pork belly ramen and it was really good. Brussels are served at room temp which is odd, but was ok because our server told us ahead of time so we didn't think we were getting food that had cooled while waiting to be delivered. The 4 star rating is due to the antipasto/app/snack confusion; it's hard to tell how and what to order. Our server was helpful, but it was still confusing. Overall it was a great experience. I would go back in a heartbeat if I lived here.
My first impression of Culinary Dropout is how much style and creativity went into the restaurant itself.  Albeit a little hard to find at first (it's tucked away near the train tracks west of Mill Ave), this place has one of the most beautiful, laid-back interiors I've seen in awhile.  In what looks to be a warehouse that was seriously remodeled, they have enough space to fit a stage for live bands, a full alcohol bar, and a plethora of seats and tables.  Speaking of live bands, they have live bands playing on the weekends, even during lunch hours!  The music was at a perfect volume: loud enough to enjoy, but quiet enough to be able to hold a conversation at your table.  Very, very nice touch of entertainment to an already good-vibes kinda place.
My wife and I came here with friends last weekend. Culinary dropout creates a great first impression. It was very clean and modern and looked like it was in a warehouse sort-of building. My wife called it an "industrial" look. We sat at a table in the back by the bar, on their patio area and it was pretty noisy but it created a fun atmosphere. We ordered soft pretzels that came with cheese sauce and those were gone within minutes. We almost ordered more! We also got the thai chicken wings which were so-so. I wasn't a big fan of those. I didn't have anything to drink, but my wife ordered "Between you & me" which had vodka, grapefruit and cranberry. I tried a sip and it was very flavorful. For dinner she had a shrimp ceaser salad which she loved and I tried the Pub burger. It was excellent! We played some lawn games and had such a fun night. Great service, great atmosphere. Wife and I will definitely be back for date night.
After sampling a Hangover Burger at the Redline Rendezvous YEE, I looked forward to going to the new MTO Cafe to try more of its offerings at the source.  So, Diane and I met another couple there to do just that.
