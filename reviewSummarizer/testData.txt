I would give 5 stars but the hipster staff looks exactly like the hipster guests and I can tell which hipster to ask for services from. I may be being harsh but I personally find it one star worth of annoying. They should at least have some sort of hipster dress code where all the hipsters look like working hipsters instead of guest hipsters. 
Absolute blast!!! Try the pretzel bites with fondue, they're amazing. Also their burgers are great. Drinks are a little pricey, but great. Also, they have games(ping pong, corn hole, etc.) Definitely a fun hangout with friends.
One of my favorite places in phoenix. the food is always good, the service is unfortunately always slow, but the food, like I said, GOOD!
Loved it! great atmosphere and the food was decent, the drinks were fabulous!
Great Hipster place!!! Meaning: 
My wife and I met her cousin and his wife for lunch on Saturday, January 9, 2016.  This was a very neat place!  There was indoor seating, but we decided to sit "outside" in a patio area.  The area was covered overhead, but was open air.  The outside temperature was very cool and the area that we sat in was equipped with over heaters as well as fire pits.
This place was so amazing! The food is to dye for!
Food, service and ping pong were awesome! My hub had the meatloaf; thumbs up there. I had the pork belly ramen and it was really good. Brussels are served at room temp which is odd, but was ok because our server told us ahead of time so we didn't think we were getting food that had cooled while waiting to be delivered. The 4 star rating is due to the antipasto/app/snack confusion; it's hard to tell how and what to order. Our server was helpful, but it was still confusing. Overall it was a great experience. I would go back in a heartbeat if I lived here.
My first impression of Culinary Dropout is how much style and creativity went into the restaurant itself.  Albeit a little hard to find at first (it's tucked away near the train tracks west of Mill Ave), this place has one of the most beautiful, laid-back interiors I've seen in awhile.  In what looks to be a warehouse that was seriously remodeled, they have enough space to fit a stage for live bands, a full alcohol bar, and a plethora of seats and tables.  Speaking of live bands, they have live bands playing on the weekends, even during lunch hours!  The music was at a perfect volume: loud enough to enjoy, but quiet enough to be able to hold a conversation at your table.  Very, very nice touch of entertainment to an already good-vibes kinda place.
My wife and I came here with friends last weekend. Culinary dropout creates a great first impression. It was very clean and modern and looked like it was in a warehouse sort-of building. My wife called it an "industrial" look. We sat at a table in the back by the bar, on their patio area and it was pretty noisy but it created a fun atmosphere. We ordered soft pretzels that came with cheese sauce and those were gone within minutes. We almost ordered more! We also got the thai chicken wings which were so-so. I wasn't a big fan of those. I didn't have anything to drink, but my wife ordered "Between you & me" which had vodka, grapefruit and cranberry. I tried a sip and it was very flavorful. For dinner she had a shrimp ceaser salad which she loved and I tried the Pub burger. It was excellent! We played some lawn games and had such a fun night. Great service, great atmosphere. Wife and I will definitely be back for date night.
Good food..a little pricey for what they serve. Had a burger here and it was pretty good. Love the live Music they had great place to go drink some beers and chill..
I'd heard good things about Culinary Dropout over the years, so I was excited to finally try it on my recent trip to Tempe. The Tempe location is quite large and we almost went in a wrong entrance (it looked like perhaps this was the entrance for private events?). 
Great atmosphere for drinks hanging out and good overall selection of food. Pretzels and cheese are clutch. Great Draft beer selection along with bottles. If your in the area definitely worth a drop in. Great service and friendly staff. FYI Friday's and Saturday nights are busy so make sure to plan Accordingly. Cheers
Lunch for 3.
Great as pub, but not so much as restaurant, especially at Friday night. One hour for us to find a high table(first come first serve), then half an hour later I received SMS from host tell me a normal table is ready...
I love the friend chicken and the fun cocktails, but mostly I enjoy the vibe. They've done a great job creating a swank atmosphere, and I like knowing that I can always go and grab a drink at the back bar while I wait for my table. A fantastic place to bring friends for an entire evening of drinks, booze, and maybe some games. I think the food is mostly solid, but you're not coming necessarily for a "culinary" experience. You're coming for the vibe. And it's a good one.
This place was super über cool.  
Appetizers were "lost" with a mere sorry as an excuse and failed to appear at all. French fries soggy and cold, less than mediocre at best. Moscow mule is good. They have nice ping pong tables. I got the prime rib sandwich, pretty good. Asking for a napkin that was not provided at the start was a real effort for our server to fetch. Overall very unimpressed with the restaurant and the attention we received and would not recommend for sit down food service. If you are set on coming here, don't expect to get what you order, be prepared to wait a long time to be seated, and don't plan on wanting to come back.
I have been here three times (last time was Jan 10th) and every time gets better!  I have had half of the menu already.  Top three must haves #1 Pretzel bites with cheese sauce, #2 Pork Belly anything, #3 Ramen bowl.   Go on Sundays for the half off specials!  
cool warehouse atmosphere, decent beer selection.   Nice informal place to hang out w/ the bar and game area
Brought the fam for an early dinner and we had a good time. 
Well, here's a first. I'm still at the restaurant and leaving a review. THAT'S how much I like this place. First, the decor and atmosphere are just cool. You instantly feel more hip and fun once you cross the threshold. It feels expensive but casual. Put together but not trying to hard. 
Great food, great service.  Love the bacon parmsean Grissini and the Bourbon black bottom pie!!!!
Great setting.  Not the usual "penny pitcher" Mill Avenue crowd.  This is where I take people when they are visiting from out of town.
Never ever, ever again.  Three strikes and you are out!! Great food and atmosphere, but the service is beyond terrible.  They comped us... Again....  That isn't the point though, their customer service is consistently terrible, and the managers recognize it and don't deny it.  It was very nice of them, but this place is a disaster!! Food is awesome and we will continue to go to the culinary dropout in Scottsdale, but we are finished with Tempe! Understaffed and they straight up do not care!!
Very good food, great casual atmosphere, and excellent staff service. Great place to come and watch a game with some friends.
Great place to spend hours!  Great food and friends as well.
First experience.  Happy Hour food was pretty good, although the chopped salad was not what we were told it was going to be.  Smoked salmon bruschetta very tasty.  Drinks just fair. Would question the 12 oz claim on HH beer.
Really cool place. It has a modern industrial 'warehouse' feel, but it's still very comfortable. 
Excellent restaurant, bar, chill spot. The food and drinks were very good (prime rib with fontina and au jus with a seasonal saison draft). Our group of 9 was quickly seated and served. After dinner, we hit up the ping pong tables and cornhole. Most other places would charge for this, but culinary drop out does it right and provides this complimentary.
The place and venue is phenomenal. Right in the heart of Tempe and Arizona State University. The energy in this place is something else. 
Loved the atmosphere. Ate here on Christmas Eve and the food/service was great. I had the Ribs and they were amazing. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect. We played ping pong and drank beer after our meal. Very happy with our choice!
I went here after looking through Yelp reviews for local eats. 
The Tempe location is pretty large & the yard is awesome! We always have great servers- always so nice! 
The food was very good! It may be a little higher priced, but you get what you pay for. Seating was comfortable and service was spot on. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the extremely loud music that made conversation almost impossible. Try the fried chicken!
I have to update my review. Literally, 3 minutes after posting my original review I received a visit at our table by the manager! He apologized for the loud music and agreed that it was too loud and instructed the folks behind the bar to reduce the volume... talk about customer service! We promptly ordered another bottle of wine and enjoyed some wonderful conversation. Thank you!!
I love the food & the atmosphere at Culinary dropout, BUT making a reservation for a group is nothing short of ridiculous.  this is not the 1st time this has come up, so I'm compelled to finally comment.  I have 9 friends in town and want to take them here BUT they don't take reservations past 6 PM.  really??????  so we're left hoping (if I decide to take them, which I won't now) we can get a hightop (again, for NINE people) or couch area, and have to wait for a table at that point.  funny, the Thirsty Lion & several others take reservation times all evening long, and always gets me in (I give them 5 starts for service, food & atmosphere).  you've lost a nice chunk of money this evening, and several others at this point, but guess that probably doesn't matter.  your bad (and no, not 'you're bad').
This is the only place in town that should be permitted to sell Pretzel Fondue. Their bartenders are great. My favorite drinks are the After School Special and their Old Fashion. 
The location is so cute- they have a fantastic venue that was set up for a wedding and the food is excellent, especially the pretzels. The brunch menu is limited but everything on there looked good.
This place is amazing! Very good food and drinks! It's a cool place to hangout with friends or have a nice dinner. I recommend the pretzels and fondue:)
Only been here once as I was visiting from out of town, but what a great visit! The food was delicious and nothing short of filling -- I personally loved the pretzel rolls and monkey bread! The ambience is casual and the place is very modern looking and comfortable! We dined towards the back near the bar area, and it was great! My cousin held her wedding rehearsal dinner here and I would definitely return if I had a group with me. No complaints, the servers seemed very friendly as well!
Can't give a good review... I showed up at 5:45 for a friends retirement dinner and didn't have my ID so I figured I'd just sit and have some food but the location that the party was "the coop" apparently doesn't even allow people in without ID so I had to leave the party and leave my girlfriend there to be with her family. I will never come back. Terrible customer service.
Update, almost immediately after posting my review, I was contacted by the staff and given an opportunity to share my exact experience. I'm impressed and appreciative of this level of customer service. While I'm currently not planning to revisit this establishment any time soon, I'm increasing my first review. 
A resounding "meh". Great place for a group to drink and play games but I was totally underwhelmed by the food. Pretzels did not have the right texture and were more like bread rolls than anything else, butternut squash pasta was undercooked and had practically no flavors other than the sweetness of the squash. I'd come back to give other menu items a shot but my first go around was really unimpressive.
Good afternoon all I just want to give a shout out to Alex. He was a great server had great customer service skills. They came in from Las Vegas Nevada for the weekend .this was my first time going to this  restaurant.  I was impress with the food , environment and like I mention the great customer service from Alex .
The atmosphere and food is great at this location. Ashley (short brown/blonde hair) made the experience even better by being an amazing server. She was extremely attentive to our tables needs and was quick to get us anything we asked for. I would return here just to have her as a server again because her service was excellent.
I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time. We went with a group and I ordered the Bistro Steak, Medium with asparagus instead of Brussel Sprouts.  The steak came out and I thought it was chicken because it was so done. I tasted it, but the waiter never came back, there were also brussel sprouts on the plate. At the end of the meal, I passed the steak off to my friend and he told the waiter why I did not eat it. The manager refused to take it off the tab and never even visited our table.The waiter told me it was because he checked on me and I said it was fine. I and everyone around me disagreed with him  and told him that I did not touch my food and waited for him to come back. He acted surprised and thought he had. I told him it was fine, but I would not be back and I was disappointed because I had heard so many positive reviews.  I did not tip him well since my understanding was the reason the manager would not remove the food from my bill was because he had said I told him it was fine. I told him I would be posting this on yelp. If you go to Tempe, pick a place who values their customers.
Fantastic vibe, food and fun.  Had a large group and everyone loved the drinks and menu items.  We shared lots of apps, had great meals, and enjoyed the games.  Being the one person from AZ in the group, I had to pick the spot for my coworkers, and I am glad i selected Culinary Dropout.  Will return!
Foods good , drink are overrated and over priced , go to eat , not to enjoy cocktails.
Close to giving this place 5 stars if not for the rude valet staff.
I've come here a half dozen times with different groups at a variety of times and it has always been a hit!  We come for work lunches and they are welcoming to large groups on separate checks.  We came with my family for new years and they had the full regular menu as well as a specials menu.  I also came for a late dinner and drinks with friends and it was a great hang out bar atmosphere.  Finally, we went with my mother in law who has extremely severe food allergies and they were informative of the ingredients in each item and very accommodating.  The wait staff is always polite, helpful and attentive.  The food and drinks are always delicious!  I highly recommend them!
"School Cafeteria Dropout" is more like it.
Went on a Monday afternoon, right when happy hour had started. Really nice atmosphere, bags ping pong tables. Carrara marble tables plush couches. Mural art of "legends" really a decor that everyone will like some aspect of it. Ordered a blind double. Because I'm classy. It's a random beer and random shot. My kind of place. Also ordered nachos and antipasti chefs choice. Both were very good!! I could see how this place would be awesome for a Friday or Saturday nights. Or Sunday funday. I'll for sure be back!
Came here once before and the service was *ok but the food was pretty good. Came here tonight to bring my sister from out of town and after this experience, I'm never going back. Came in and was told I would be waiting an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. Considering it was Friday night and they were kind of busy, I understood and decided to get some drinks. After an hour and a half I decided to go ask the hostesses what was going on and they told me "there's only a couple more tables ahead of you". After another half hour of waiting I went up and asked again and they gave me the same answer. What bothered me is that they didn't even seem to care or sympathize that I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours or try to reassure me that I would be called soon (even though we had already watched several tables get seated before us). I'm very disappointed in the service we had experienced and will not be returning, at least to this location.
Food & drinks are amazing here!! I got great service too! Try the pretzel bites and the pastrami sandwich!!!
Melissa had Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. I had deviled eggs, monkey bread, and Thai chili chicken wings. Deviled eggs were a little salty for my taste. Everything else was great, and very fresh. Lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try. 
Opps! How have we not found this place sooner! We will definitely be back! 
This is a fun place to hangout, but $10 for a drink called, "Room Service", that comes in what looks like a Barbie sized champagne glass...seriously, come on guys. Rip off.
Great place for drinks. Classic decor with a modern touch makes for a welcoming atmosphere. Spicy cocktails are
Thanks Brian (the manager) for taking care of us after our experience. Speaks volumes. 
My favorite place. Outstanding food and drinks. A more sophisticated place to have great time than any place on mill.
I've had one positive and one somewhat negative experience at this location. The first time I came here with a large group for a birthday and the second time was just with my girlfriend. When we were told we had a 45 minute wait, we waited an hour for a text that never came, since they never put us on their list.
Went there based on the hype that the restaurant receives.  We had an enjoyable evening.
After attending a great show at Gammage theater today, we went to an early dinner at Culinary Dropout. I ordered one of the signature dishes ( fried chicken) that they have highlighted as being one of there best items. The chicken was not cooked fully, somewhat bloody. 
Awesome food and great service. Me and my bf had burgers. However, that salted caramel custard was to die for. We should have ordered two because I did not want to share. Will be back.
This place has a great ambiance that's trendy and casual. It is family friendly before dark but even then it can be iffy depending on the crowd. It is a college hangout with ASU a stones throw away so you have a mix crowd but mostly with college kids. They have a nice outdoor area with couches and pool and bags. The food was good, service could be better and the prices vary depending on what you're there for but I guess average.   While it is cool, I felt very old and out of place even being in my early 30s with my family.
Very tasty Ribeye, surprisingly good brussels sprouts.  Potatoes cooked to perfection, and a great beer selection...what more can you ask for?  Service was good, definitely a happening place if you ware looking to socialize.  It can be on the loud side, if you are looking for a quiet place, this might not be for you.  
Awesome atmosphere. Was a fun place for a first date! Had a good time.
The atmosphere at this place is incredible! Ask for Maggie as your server! Easily the best service I've ever received!
Nice people, but I ordered ribs and they were cold in the middle. First bites ok, but then third rib and they weren't hot, rather cold. No Bueno. Otherwise big space and lots of regular bar menu items on tap, people having good time. Cold pork is no Bueno.
The squash pasta & Gorgonzola salad were amazing! I wasn't impressed the first time. I loved the atmosphere though. Super fun & chill!!! So we tried it again. But after my second visit I'll definitely be back again!!! Love this place for hanging with friends!
This place is awesome. Great vibe, plenty of space inside (bar area in the front and back), games section with ping pong tables and corn hole boards, and the food is outstanding. The custom drinks were all excellent although the bartenders at the front (main) bar were at times inattentive and aloof. If you want to get away from the crowd go to the back bar (The Coop) - better service and calmer atmosphere. For Antipasti - the meat and cheese tray was delicious (make sure you choose the small batch beef jerky as one of your options). Soup & Share - the pretzels and provolone fondue are a MUST and one order is enough to serve three people. The pork belly nachos are also solid but could definitely use more pork belly. Entrees - the 36 hour pork ribs were good but nothing to write home about. The Korean Style Ribeye Cap is solid with a nice char on the outside and great flavor profile overall. The star was definitely the fried chicken. Crispy and flavorful breading on the outside, tender and moist chicken on the inside (it comes with three pieces). Overall this concept works and provides a very enjoyable drinking and dining experience.
Interesting place
This place is uber fun!  It has everything you need for a fun night out.  Good food, lots of beer, good service, and a really cool atmosphere.  We spent probably 4 plus hours here.  We came a little early to get a bigger table..and we were successful, scoring an 8 seater.
Very chic and chill. They have colorful cocktails with non-standard liquors and food thats not too bad. Additionally, the setup is pretty fun; outdoors they have pingpong and cornhole with another bar at the very end. Its a cool place to not go too party-ish, but only a little. I usually take my friends from out of town here for the last night.
This place is hipster to the max!!  I mean, this place literally reeks of hipster which to some may not be such a bad thing..haha.
Amazing fried chicken & biscuits. $18 Friendly service. Young crowd. Industrial  feel. Loud music.
Was in town for a quick turnaround with the Family the food was great Fried chicken hit the spot. Also tried the Porkbelly nachos must have. Good selection of craft beer and a lot of fun games to keep you entertained. Our server Richard did a great Job you need to try this place.
Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable on everything and could answer any question with confidence in seconds. Her describing how they made the fried chicken sold it for my wife and I. And....yea the chicken tasted like it came from back home.(im from TN) the mashed potatoes were very creamy and the biscuit just topped it all. 
My first experience here and it was amazing. We came on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't packed and there was plenty of parking.
Trendy, Relaxing, and Really Good Food!
Good food. Loud echoing atmosphere. Services staff that was clearly hired only for their image.
Very fun atmosphere. Great service. Good drink selection. Small menu but very good food, especially the appetizers. Good for groups. Good tempe location. Easy parking with valet avaliable.
I enjoy coming to this place because my 10 year old son loves it. He has Angelman Syndrome and any chance we can go out to an upbeat, fun place he loves it. The entire experience would be awesome if the servers weren't rushing their guest out. Every time we come we enjoy taking our time to relax and have dinner. Because of my sons special needs he eats slower than most people but every time we come it's like the server brings the check before we can finish our meal. Tonight was an extreme case. The girl who took over our original server was rude and pushy. She never asked us if we needed anything just brought the check before my family was even done. There are no other people waiting to sit here so why push out the guest you have who determine your tip. I appreciate the restaurant but would love a little more time to relax
Food was delicious, but a little pricey for what you get. The atmosphere was a really chill area (see pictures) which would be great in the summer. The turkey sandwich was really good and fresh. My family got the reuben which were very flavorful.  The downfall of the place is that there are many ingredients on each item which could not be good for picky eaters. The service was really good, but the waiter kept taking away our drinks when we still had a 1/3 of our drinks left. I hate wasting.
Heard great things about this trendy place. I took friends that came in to Phoenix for just the day, and it being my first time too, we were all impressed.
While visiting town from the foodie capital of the the country (Portland), I decided to try this place out. I had lived in Phoenix for twenty years and was familiar with the Sam Fox concept restaurants. Culinary Dropout is a hybrid of Sauce and The Arrogant Butcher, which was disappointing. Many menu items were identical and in a tragic twist of fate, less tasty than I remembered. 
Came here after a work meeting with a large group of coworkers. Very friendly and quick service! Excellent happy hour menu lots of options and very very yummy. I will definitely be back sometime!
Very loud, very busy place especially for a Wednesday night. Gastropub in this farmer place slash airport hangar. Menu has lots of stuff, appetizers including "make your own cheese board". I got the fried chicken plate and it was okay. Disneyland chicken is better and about the same price. The biscuit was hard and cold, the mashed potatoes were slightly salty. The best thing ? Roasted Brussel sprouts ! Very tasty.
I was a little overwhelmed by the size of "the yard" when I first walked down the long dark hallway and saw the restaurant in its entirety.  And while, yes it was very loud it was a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  I've found some "hipster" places to also have what I refer to as "rude hipster too cool for school service."  However this was not the case with Culinary Dropout.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server offered great suggestions and checked on us frequently.
Shared the pretzel fondue, normally something I wouldn't touch but they are perfectly crisp on the outside with a freshly baked doughy center and the fondue is creamy, de andante but not too heavy. 
Always amazing. Always worth it. 
Love, Love this place, Ambiance feels like your going to eat at somebody's home.
A bit pricey at times, but the drink specials are great and the food is quality. Also great environment for fun with friends.
I did a lot of research to find a place to take my bosses to lunch since they are visiting from San Diego this week.  I did my research and this was close to my office and had great reviews so I decided to roll the dice.  I was absolutely not disappointed!  From the small plate appetizers to share to the wonderful salads we got for our entrees, everything was outstanding.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and the food was amazing!  I recommend the Antipasta salad.  The portion was just right and there was no shortage of meat and cheese so you had some in every bite!  Very happy and will definitely be taking my family here for dinner soon.
We had a team dinner here. It was great. Food was wonderful the salads are amazing. Played ping pong, corn hole, fuse ball. Really good food and the atmosphere was fun.
The muscles for appetizer were delish . We ordered the steak and the Korean Rib eye , both spot on and delish...I really wish they made sweet potato fries, chips , or pretty much anything ...
Awesome service, friendly staff, and delicious food. Not to mention a badass atmosphere and stellar drinks. Meranda was my server and she was filled with info on the menu. What more could you ask for? Nothing wrong with dropping out if the food is this good.
Clubby atmosphere.  But great food and selection of beer. We had fish and chips, ribs, and tortellini.  Everything was tasty and filling.  The place is huge!  You HAVE to try the pretzels with fondue.
This place is great. Burger is the bomb, went back again and had the breakfast special which was also great. I would eat there every weekend if I could. Cool atmosphere friendly staff prompt service.
This place just has a cool vibe, especially the Moulin-Rouge-ish light fixtures and hipster-looking employees. I really enjoyed our antipasti choice: jamón ibérico (for the salty goodness), garlic & herb goat cheese (soft and creamy...probably the best goat cheese I've ever had!), roasted beets & balsamic (perfectly tart and juicy to cut the saltiness of our protein and richness of the cheese), and the truffle potato chips (which was "ok" but added some crunch to complete our appetizing mix). As an extra (free) compliment, they surprised us with some sweet candied grapes which worked well with our small charcuterie board. We didn't have any alcohol, but I felt a bit buzzed after completing our meal, probably from all the tyramine, haha! I personally wouldn't eat here on a daily basis, but would recommend as a fun trendy place to hang out with friends on a special occasion.
This place is HUGE! Couches can be reserved as well as the back room area. There was a group of 25 of us and there was a spot reserved along with buffet style appetizers. This included a large meat/cheese/nut board, small sandwiches and chips. There was an operating bar back there that made for fast service.
The food and atmosphere is wonderful! The atmosphere is fun and comfortable and very warm and inviting. The different smells of the food are overwhelming, in a great way that makes your stomach immediately excited for food. The food itself was delicious, everything looked and smelled so good. I ended up ordering the Kale Caesar Fried Shrimp Salad and it was delicious! The server recommended getting the shrimp sautéed instead and it was a great decision. I couldn't stop eating it. Others in my group ate burgers, and they were huge and looked so good. The servings are generous and the drinks are good and generous too!
Service was excellent. The food was mediocre. Shaved Prime Rib Dip ($18) was a standard ($8) French Dip anywhere else in America, French fries were cold and rubbery. A friend had Beer Battered Fish and Chips and was equally disappointed. The high prices reflect the high overhead of the place and not better food ingredients. We'll not be returning.
I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a great drink, an even better burger, and a bustling environment! One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that they have games like ping pong and bags (cornhole) to play with friends at your leisure. Another aspect of this restaurant that I enjoy is the decorations/furnishings. It really brings the restaurant to life. Apart from the environment, I would go back simply because my food was delicious. Not only did my burger taste delicious, it also smelled delicious! The portion size was perfect in my opinion. I am looking forward to my next visit!
Fun place, love the outdoor bean bag toss options.
This place has an amazing vibe. Love that they have a ton of couches for seating - definitely sit outside if you have opportunity. The handcrafted shandies are also worth a try. We're from out of town, but if we lived here we would be regulars for sure.
Cool atmosphere here and I really like that the servers can wear their own clothes. Super hipster little place with a big "backyard" that has ping pong tables and corn hole. Great drinks. Delicious pretzels and fried chicken  would recommend people come check it out. When I was there Saturday night it was so easy to find parking, but Wednesday was jam-packed! Will absolutely be coming back.
I would give it at least 4 but I'm not getting the scantily clad waitresses.  Sorry I know this a
This place is great, spacious, nice staff, good food.
Came here for a work party over christmas, really great space for parties. The only issue i think would be the parking. We tried to have our rehearsal dinner here, but decided it would be too difficult for our guests to find parking, and the cost of the food was more than our wedding!
I only went here once because I had a $75 worth of Fox Restaurant gift cards and this is the only place in Tempe... I think. Anyways, I decided to take my parents here for a nice, relaxing Saturday lunch... Not what I experienced.
Great place great food and very friendly service I recommend this place to anyone who wants great food and not all the traffic of mill ave.
Food is amazing. Atmosphere is fun and happening. Great place to get great food and have a good time.
I was able to make last minute lunch reservations for a group of 8 for 30 minutes after my call time. I was not able to make them online for the same time though, so try calling them if you are denied online. 
Excellent food and the dining room was great. Live music, lots of space, and a ton of natural lighting. Too bad it's on the east side as it would be my go to lunch spot. Everything we ordered was delicious, but the fries stood out. I would recommend to everyone looking for a relaxed lunch/brunch.
No idea why this place is rated so high. I have been here twice now.
Great atmosphere, food, and service! Great date place or hangout with friends. Had the room service to drink and turkey pastrami to eat. Both were yummy!
Better than average bar food. The pretzel fondue is good for sharing with a table. I've been there several times & service can be a little slow. I've had a range of very helpful to completely inattentive servers. The enormous parking lot is a huge plus - way easier to come & go than other places on/close to Mill.
A great atmosphere with great workers! I went here with a friend about a week ago and loved it! We went during happy hour and snacked on some pretzels and sangria, then ordered some salads. A little on the pricey side if you're going for dinner, but totally worth it. I definitely plan on going here again. The menus big, but you can't go wrong.
I loved this location! I usually go to the one in Phoenix and this was my first time going here. I brought a friend from out of town and he was impressed with the food. The beer selection is always great and we had a nice comfy couch like booth that fit about 5 of us comfortably. Good experience, good service. I will be back.
Bill Dutcher on the first Saturday of every month is tough to beat. Great location, great food, great drinks, great music. 
This is a very cool place! The food was outstanding. I highly recommend the ribs. We also had a fabulous waitress. We will definitely be back!
Excellent location, plenty of parking, and the food was delicious.  We like trying new things, so tried the strawberry jalapeño margarita (it had a fancy name but I can't remember it!) - it was absolutely delicious, as was the classic mule.  The deviled eggs were very good, and I had to try it the prime rib dip sandwich, even if it was $17.  I hate to pay that much for a sandwich, but I have to say it was one of the best I've ever had.  Our server was attentive and explained the background of the restaurant since this was our first visit & was very nice.  I only gave this four stars, because two drinks and a sandwich cost me $45.  I would love to come back again & again, but at that price point I'm not sure I can afford to - but I sure will try!
I've been here a few times and I really like it! The atmosphere is AWESOME! I love the live music and all the activities in the yard area. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE  is their PRETZEL BITES with fondue!! TO DIE FOR!! DELISH! plssssss try them! Lol
The chicken probably would have been good if it didn't taste like fish. Time to change the oil?  The crisps and onion dip were quite good, so the experience wasn't a total bust, but for the prices they are charging, I expected my chicken to taste like chicken.
Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places to eat at. I have never been disappointed at the quality of food. My favorite appetizer is their Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I have a corn allergy and have been able to eat these every time. My favorite cocktail that they make is the Spanish Apple Tango. I would reccomend anything on their menu. Their ingrediants are quality and that is pretty much the reason why I can eat there.
The staff is very courteous and very knowledgeable regarding drink and food taste. They go so far as to compare it to things that I happen to know and love back in NYC. The Gin and tonic #33 is definitely one of the best gin and tonics I have ever consumed. The usage of uncommon gin, with a touch I haven't seen anywhere else. The precision and craft is taken to the next level. The fried chicken, I would put up to most other places I have tried throughout the country.
Culinary Dropout has created a very unique experience with beautiful interior layout expansive ceilings in-game area.
We had such a great time last time we were there.  There was a band on Saturday that was so easy to listen to and relaxing called Vinyl Station!  They sound great!  Our food was good and our waitress was nice.  Its nice to watch people having fun with all of the games, and seeing the food coming out for parties.  Nice presentation!
This place was cool.  Its huge has great bartenders and good live music. 
This place has a positive ambiance. I met a woman here for our first date and although it was very crowded (Wednesday) and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, once we were seated, the other tables, the crowd, and even the live music on stage were not at all frustrating distractions; my date and I were able to talk and get to know one another in peace and comfort. 
Love this place. Food is great, fun environment, live music on the weekends. I like that there's usually a mix of old and young people, singles and families. Great place to bring people visiting from out of town. 
We came here on a late Thursday night after a concert at the Marquee.
Oh my God this food is amazing.  Great atmosphere and staff. Pork belly nachos, onion dip, pretzels and cheese, French dip and meatloaf taste so good it makes you want to smack your mama. My new favorite spot.
Went for lunch, really nice atmosphere with cool live music! Pretzels with fondue and pork nachos were amazing, left feeling stuffed.
My favorite place to eat in Tempe, hands down. We've been here three times and will make sure we bringe visitors and out of towners  here. It's fun, drinks, ambience, games, tvs, music and great times rolled into one night. You won't go wrong here. Great for an adult birthday gathering.
To be honest, I was expecting something more based on other friends opinions. The food was just okay, nothing super special to me. The waiter described the food like it was so unique and savory but when I tasted it, it left me wanting more. Other than that, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun and easy.
Food was good, not great. Our server was bad. She hardly checked on us. She took a long time to take our drink order and food order. It was not a busy day. We went long periods until they refilled our waters.
This place is fun! The atmosphere is amazing and there is live music on the weekend. Try the fondue pretzels or the antipasta plate. They have happy hour too.
Tough location to find off Mill however worth the Sherlock Holmes. Stopped by at the suggestion of my business partner who had a long day....until we started with the cocktails. Mule was nice however the lemon, jalapeno, nectar. 
Great place enjoy a Friday night. Very much liked it! A friend found this place and we decided to try it. We both had a great time and service was phenomenal.
Highly recommend this restaurant! We are a family of 4 on vacation! Loved it! Great service great food great atmosphere! Great prices!! Hope the restaurant comes to the east coast!! Payne our server who is a LAX player for ASU was super attentive! Can't say enough good things! So happy we came here

Food and service were great!
Their fried chicken is on point, go get some! Their desserts are also awesome!
I don't know how I didn't know about this place before.. This place is very big with indoor and outdoor seating.. They have happy hour Monday thru Friday 2-5... My friend and I ordered the Korean shrimp and chicken, pretzel
My husband & I had a quick lunch at the Phoenix location by ourselves a few months ago & decided we had to take the kids to check it out. Since we live in Mesa we chose to visit the Tempe location by ASU this time. We are a big fan of the pretzels with cheese. The best part is that the cheese is kept warm by a small flame beneath it (we also enjoy the pretzels with cheese at The Tavern Grill & Teakwoods). 
I wanted to take my husband here when we visited Phoenix. I had been to the other location and liked it, so tried his new location....it was awesome!  The place is really cool and has an awesome vibe, with live music, good beer, and even ping pong tables and cornhole! I recommend the pretzel bites for sure! I had roast beef sandwich and my husband had the grid chicken. Neither of us were disappointed.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in AZ!
First timer... Had the seared tuna salad with a Gin and Tonic cocktail. It was a great first visit. Loved the atmosphere and people were nice.  Food and Drink was great! Will be back!
Listen, in Tempe it's a challenge to find the "whole package" in a single restaurant but Culinary Dropout in Tempe at The Yard IS just that. A unicorn in an area of Tempe that caters to college kids. Excellent multi-use space - we had dinner on a Tues night when the lights were low and the place was hopping and went back for lunch on a Saturday when the bright sunshine poured in - high quality service and food BOTH times. The staff were friendly and seemed to really like working there. They knew the menu and were genuinely proud of the food coming out of that kitchen. I recommend Culinary Dropout at The Yard enthusiastically!
Went on a Friday like we had previously for their happy hour. But apparently, "happy hour is not available on weekends only M-TH." Since when a Friday a weekend? If so, why is it part of my workweek?! They should really update their website as it is misleading. Happy hour menu displays M-F. Service and food was also subpar to what we had been accustomed to here.
5-stars for cool ambiance, 3-stars for undercooked chicken wings. We had a work dinner at Culinary Dropout which included a myriad of shared dishes and cocktails. I had my heart set on chicken wings which were unfortunately not cooked correctly. Kitchen mishaps happen, but of all the chicken joints in the world... why did it have to happen to mine? Other than the chicken wings dinner overall was a pleasant experience with the pretzel bites and cheese being my favorite dish! Will give it another try on my next visit to Phoenix!
Tovah, our server, was fantastic. She was extremely attentive, helpful, energetic, and very quick to get things done. I ordered the salmon entree and asked her if butter was used in preparing the dish. She said that she would be sure to let the chef know to omit butter. She even went out of her way to come back and let me know that some of the chefs may choose to use butter, so to request no butter on future visits. I was really impressed by this attention to detail. I was also equally impressed by Ryan P., the bartender. He was also extremely helpful, professional, and had great energy. The service was top notch and made for a very warm, welcoming environment. I will be back and recommend to friends! It's such a great spot. Thank you!
I came here with my best friend and his wife on a work trip to Phoenix and really enjoyed it. The decor was cool, server was nice, and the layout of the restaurant was really big and open which I liked. We had the ribs, kale salad, and Thai chicken wings all which were awesome. Their cocktails looked rad so I will try one next time when I am in town.
2 words PRETZEL BALLS
Honestly, I loved this place for so many reasons. 
What a wonderful experience!  The food is EXCELLENT, the service fantastic, and the atmosphere very fun.  If  you are in Phoenix, make this part of your plans.
Happy hour was great. Ended up in the middle of a shift change and never got helped after cashing out, which was the only negative. Drinks and food were all really good.
Good food, happy hour starts too early and ends at 5 PM but understandavle due to it's location in downtown Tempe.
Pretty good food overall and a unique atmosphere as well. This place is HUGE and set up well for groups or for those wanting to just catching a game. They also have live entertainment which was enjoyable to listen to as well.
I really only write experiences when I encounter a problem or am blown away by a restaurant. This one happens to be the former. I've always enjoyed myself here: great beer selection, fun games, decent food. However, last night I met up with some friends to celebrate a birthday. I had called ahead to make sure it was OK to bring a small liquor bottle (completely sealed, unopened) as a present for him, and was told it wouldn't be a problem. I've also seen this happen quite a few times before with bigger bottles and bottles of wine from other guests while I've been here before. While we were playing games, security called me over, and told me I need to leave. Security said they could hold it at the host stand with my driver's license to pick up at the end of the night, so I accepted, but was met by one of the hosts/managers a minute later telling me I need to leave. 
What's not to love!!! This place is a great place whether to just hang it with friends or come in on a date.  
I ate and drank at the Coop inside Culinary Dropout. I small bar dedicated to the 21 up crowd. It was a full service bar so I was able to indulge in a adult beverage and food. 
Update: I was reached out to by the business manager who informed me happy hour is STILL on for Friday's. She went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction  so we will definitely be returning for more happy hours!
This place is walking distance between my apartment and Mill Avenue. It is easily one of my favorite spots to spend an after work gathering of Sunday afternoon with some friends. They have corn hole and bar games in the back of the venue and nice selection of beers indoors. I particularly like the Menu because they have a bit of everything. I like to get their cheese plate, Thai wings and pretZel fondue. The main entrees are even more expensive but I imagine still worth it because everything here is amazing.
I tried the Meze Platter, as I was not disappointed! Service was quick and friendly, and for a cafe, it was nice to have the owner Ben stop by the table. This is a great addition to Downtown Summerlin! I will be back, and can't wait to try more items on the menu!
Awesome service! Food was surprisingly really good for a small Cafe. The lady with the strong funny accent at the counter was really helpful with some menu selections.
I am so happy to have MTO Café open in Downtown Summerlin.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.
MTO Cafe has opened its second location at Downtown Summerlin, open from 9:00am-9:00pm daily.  This means that its fans can now have MTO for dinner and that's what four of us did tonight.  I've only ever had breakfast at the original location on Main Street so I've been curious to see what their other menu items are like.  Tonight's choice was the chicken pot pie, comfort food that's apropos for the fall weather.  MTO's version is served piping hot in a skillet with four buttermilk biscuits, shredded chicken, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks: so tasty!  The biscuits serve as the "crust" of the dish and it's definitely a hearty meal.  A generous serving, I shared it with the pals and they agreed that it was delicious.  
Great experience and delicious food. The lovely young lady who to our order was sweet and gave great recommendations. I accidentally order the grilled cheese instead of the kids grilled cheese and they fixed it ASAP. The Bob Sandwich was delicious, the wings were different and fantastic, fries were thin and hot and the MTO doughnuts were mmmMM honeylicious. I recommend this place over Crave or Skinny Fats. It's yummy comfort food for less than $50.
MTO Cafe is the hot off the press restaurant that recently opened its doors in Las Vegas's hot new shopping destination: Downtown Summerlin. After hanging out in Sabalatte, my brother and I decided to drive to Downtown Summerlin to experience MTO Cafe. 
This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.  
Wow, this place has some impressive craftsmanship in the food.  The flavors of the Hangover burger are perfectly executed, the medium request on burger patty was dead on, and its actually seasoned!  
I stopped here for lunch today and had the buffalo Ruben sandwich.  I have to say it is one of the best Rubens I have ever had and I like good Ruben.  The fries were also good, but nothing special.  A little on the high side price-wise for a sandwich at a counter service restaurant considering Jason's deli also does a really good one under $10.
This place just keeps getting better! I've visited the Downtown location many times and the one in Summerlin is just as great. The whole atmosphere is really cool. 
Not only was the menu interesting, the food tasted excellent!, high recommends for the chicken pot pie and the Rueben!!
Although the staff was friendly, the customer service was absolutely terrible. I ordered three simple drinks. A coffee, a vanilla latte, and a hot chocolate. We sat down, expecting our drinks to be ready within few minutes, just as we would wait at other cafes. We waited nearly 20 minutes until we finally decided to depart and demand a refund. In that time, two other groups of people were served their drinks within a few minutes of placing their orders. One party consisted of six people in which they all ordered a drink. At the demand of our refund the manager openly said,"I'm sorry. Our priorities are backwards." Um? Sir, if your priorities are backwards I'm not too sure you should be operating a cafe.
This place is super cozy, food is amazing. I had the mto breakfast and I loved it. Staff is nice and efficient.it can be a little crowded though. If you check in with yelp you get a free cookie, kudos for that. I will be back for sure
Stopped in for a sandwich while holiday shopping. Was first time customer and the counter clerk suggested the turkey melt. Was supposed to be on sourdough bread but just looked like regular toast to me. Turkey was sliced very thin and just tasted like processed turkey you buy from Oscar Mayer or something. Topped with wafer this slice of tomato and ugh.... Shredded iceberg lettuce. What is this a Big Mac? Did not smell appetizing in the least. Someone brought it to my table, dropped it without so much as a word and took off. Three stars for this is generous I tell you. 
This is one of the new locations in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Excellent location and beautifully modeled. 
The MTO cafe is another great addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. In door and patio dining are available. The indoor space is brightly lit and has comfortable seating. Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people.
Their food is quite good; there are lots of reviews that attest to that.  But this review is specifically about their awesome customer service.
I absolutely love MTO Cafe.  Their food is healthy, fresh and yummy.  I highly recommend it.  David the manager is especially awesome.  He always welcomes me and makes sure my dining experience is great.   I will definitely be back.
MTO is fantastic! Great food and great service! The manager David is awesome! They have both healthy food and comfort food! Great place for kids!  Check this place out you won't be sorry!
He got the Turkey Melt (avocado, tomatoes, jack & cheddar, chipotle aioli on sourdough + fries). "It tasted like McDonalds." An interesting association...
Good eating!
A cute cafe with some big flavors. 
I really enjoy walking into an establishment and being greeted warmly. And that's exactly how it was here when we walked in for breakfast. Even though it was crazy busy inside the staff all had smiles and were nice and friendly! That makes a huge difference! 
Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- décor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.
I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why. 
Went to Downtown Summerlin location based on a recommendation. Arrived about 8:30, web says it opens at 8. Doors locked, employees looking at us from inside, don't bother to come to the door. Went to another door. Employee sitting a table drinking coffee doesn't come to the door. Apparently they were closed and it was too much of an effort for one of the employees inside to come to the door on a cold morning and let the 3 customers know why. With the growth of restaurants in Summerlin, this is the fastest way to grow bust. I typically write a review after I've dined in the restaurant but in this case their behavior speaks to me about the nature of this place. Doubt we will give it another try, too many other options.
The young lady that took our order was very polite and pleasant. ThIs was our first time here so we had a lot of questions. Every time that we asked a question, Diana would jump in the conversation to answer. I believe she is the boss. Maybe if she quit micromanaging her employees, they could flourish on their own. 
I still haven't had anything exceptional...
MTO cafe is one of the new additions to the Summerlin mall. This is a small cozy cafe. The food is good and the ingredients are very fresh. We ordered the Turkey Melt and the Hero Sandwich. They were very good, I'm not sure which one was better. The bread was soft and crunchy and the portion size was very good. I'm not sure if the value is there though. We end up paying $30 bucks for two sandwiches which seems a bit more than your average cafe. You have the option to change your fries for salad or fruit at an additional price. I guess there is not much of an encouragement to pick healthy options. I got the simple salad and that is exactly what I got, a simple salad. Lettuce, one sun dried tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was good, but nothing crazy to it. 
Food was pretty good.  
I have found my MTO breakfast. What a success. 
I've been really wanting to try this place out since I would always pass by the dtlv location. I finally had a chance while shopping in downtown summerlin, and I am mind blown of how delicious it was! 
The restaurant is well done & trendy. Great spot. Menu is certainly big enough and should have something for everyone. I've eaten here twice this week. Had the Philly cheesesteak. It was really awesome. Perfectly cooked. Today I had a Ruben sandwich which was also very good. Well trimmed, so not fatty. My only complaint is it seems a bit pricey. $17 for  lunch without a server.  But the food is really good. So...  I guess I'll pay!
So glad to have an MTO Cafè approx. 10 minutes away!
Yummy comfort food. The deconstructed chicken pot pie is awesome, wonderful gravy that soaks into the biscuits. The grilled brie cheese sandwhich is creative and perfect for a sweet tooth. 
Great food and super fast service from the ladies but I did notice the manager (I assume) playing on his phone behind the counter.  If your not going to help them get out of view of customers.  The chicken pot pie was scrumptious!
Pros:
I decided to check this place out with my coworkers. It's a cute, bright, modern, casual, hipster joint where you order at the counter, they give you a #, and bring out your food. We ordered the chicken in a waffle, queso fundido, 5 cheese mac-n-cheese, and an avocado skillet. Our food came out fast, probably less than five minutes. I enjoyed everything I tasted. Service is efficient and they came by often to check up on us and take away our plates when we were done.
Came for lunch at the MTO Café on a Monday afternoon (MLK day) and it was extremely busy.  That was okay with me because you counter order, then get a number so your food can be brought to you.  The long line gave me a chance to peruse the paper menu before I could read the menu board at the counter.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outside tables were in the shade at that time, so I was glad a table opened up inside when we were ready to sit down.
A mistake. The food was heavy and greasy. I had The Bob which was not nearly as light and organic as it sounds and James had the Mac and cheese which was only ok. My latte was essentially a cup of milk with some coffee in it--almost no foam. Overall everything was definitely not worth the $30 it cost. At all. 
You can't seat your customers because you're open yet closed because your staff is watching Superbowl?  Turning away business for some arbitrary reason?  We were going to join our friends for lunch until we heard they gave this flimsy excuse!  Seriously!
Stating from the day it was announced that I felt MTO Café was the most relevant restaurant on the list of eateries at Downtown Summerlin it is with some shame that it took so long to visit after the store's opening, but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations at the Downtown location several months prior I'm happy to report the dinner selections in the shadow of Red Rock are just as well done.
I stand corrected, I've been back three times because this little cafe has excellent food. Breakfast is outstanding, try the pancakes or steak and eggs. Dinner very good, in fact I'd rate the quality of their food product better than Crave next door. Give it a try!
This was our first time venturing to downtown Summerlin. This cafe was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious. They serve the breakfast items all day. Decent kids menu. Options of menu choices were fair in terms of number of different items, but what they do make was delicious. Lots of choices from the fancy soda fountain. I liked that there were non-carbonated items for the kids too. Ambience is contemporary and modern. Overall, we had a great experience and plan to return in the future.
The food was ok, nothing special. The portions were small, we had to go some place else and get snacks because we were still hungry. The food was way over priced, $13 for one waffle and flavorless fruit was ridiculous. I wouldn't go back. The only saving feature was that the atmosphere was nice.
This is a casual place where you can get a quick breakfast or lunch. I've heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try. 
I love the food at MTO - Downtown more than this location. They pretty much have the same menu items but for some reason the execution isn't the same.
First time here, I'm trying the teriyaki turkey burger and lolu wings.  The wife is trying their honey walnut grilled cheese. 
We're always looking for new breakfast places to try, so decided to venture out to this cafe. I was disappointed in their limited breakfast menu, they basically have a few omelets and the standard  3 eggs and choice of meat items. The cafe is small and you order at the counter. They have outdoor seating but no awning or umbrellas to help give you a bit of shade. Since nothing on their breakfast menu was appealing to me, I ordered the vegan falafal and my partner ordered the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast. He said that his breakfast was ok, but nothing he would order again. My falafal on the other hand was absolutely delicious. The falafals were very flavorful and I loved the light basalmic tahini sauce, it was just right and did not overpower the falafal, it comes served on a bed of mixed greens in a wrap of soft bread. I would definitely come back for this.
I like coming here to have breakfast around the Summerlin area after we hit up Costco on our weekend shopping.  I like the bacon pancakes.
Coffee, coffee, coffee...doesn't have to be Sambalatte quality but match Micky Ds. I'm hoping I just had a bad brew, but if you serve breakfast offer a solid brew. I'm all for do it yourself, but put the cream and sugar on my TABLE I don't wanna have to get up and go to the counter if I have another cup because the first one was weak. Done with that rant. Food was awesome,  waffles were fluffy, and the mto breakfast was cooked excellent. The best thing here: MASHED HASH BROWNS absolutely something to start your day eating a hybrid of chive mashed potatoes and crispy hash browns. I'll return, but its not the best breakfast I'd had in Vegas. Best in downtown Summerlin though. Ha!
This is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Las Vegas. The food is outstanding and in my opinion, affordable for what you get. I've had the hangover burger, which had so much flavor, and the fried egg added a great touch! But the most delicious dish I had was the B.L.T.A.E! If you come here, you absolutely need to order it! They give you a big portion and everything in the sandwich is heavenly! MTO is the place to be!!
MTO Cafe is easily one of the best places in summerlin. Every item I've had has been delicious. My conclusion is that these chefs are way over qualified and I'm glad I get to enjoy their cooking regularly. Each meal seems to be so clean and well put together, As if only the best ingredient had been  hand picked individually to create the meal.
great healthy food for great price!!! huge portion. i love this place. worth my first yelp review
Bland.  Boring.  Weird open-faced BLT that was more bread than anything else.  I was there when they were still fairly new in this location.  Not in a rush to return, but would be open to giving them a second go.
Counter service. The people that deliver the food ask if you need anything else, but don't mean it. We didn't know where the silverware and napkins were so when they dropped of our food, we asked for utensils. She said, "they are on the counter." and left. They dropped of my dad's pancakes without any butter. The bussers were extremely rude. As we were standing up to leave, I was gathering my baby's things, the busser asked us to move so he could clear the table. I understand needing the table, but they couldn't wait the 30 second for us to leave. The food is incredibly bland, and I ordered chorizo, an item that is typically full of flavor. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, the country gravy tasted like flour. My mom had the avocado omelet. The avocado was still hard since it wasn't ripe enough. My sister ordered an omelet that came with a side salad. That "salad" consisted of no more than 7 leaves and no dressing (see photos). I literally laughed. It looked like an incomplete garnish. Definitely pass on this one.
After shopping in downtown Summerlin we decide to grab a bite to eat! The line wasn't bad and we actually got a seat on the patio. I waited 30 minutes to get a turkey wrap. My friend that was with me, ordered before me never received his meal (Chicken wrap). I finished my entire meal before he got up to speak with the manager. The manager stated that his meal would be the next one up. At this point he was beyond hungry so we waited around another 15 minutes . Still after 15 minutes he still hadn't received his meal, so we asked for a refund and left! All in all they have the WORST customer service I have ever seen. The fries were about all I could care for. If your looking for some good fries and bad customer service this is the place to go!
We went here for a little brunch to celebrate a family holiday. I ordered chorizo & eggs in a skillet. Now I don't know where you come from but a breakfast skillet that I am used to is totally full with eggs, meat & potatoes. I would be surprised if this was a two-egg omelet because it was in the middle of a skillet with a tiny amount of hash browns & a smattering of chorizo & small amount of avocado. All this for $11 & I had to eat again afterward because it so small. Now come on MTO give your customers what they paid for & put some more food on the plate!! I know food costs & breakfast is the highest margin meal to serve!!
Friendly prompt service.  Good food for a new and developing location.  Great if you are looking for a quick bite that is on par with the price point.
I had the Reuben.... Pretty delicious. I'll be coming back to try more of the dishes they offer. Fries are skinny and good as well.
Two words come to mind - overpriced and mediocre.
Will be here once a week for breakfast... Going to try lunch and dinner later maybe 3 times a week type of place
This place is awesome. Great outdoor seating, fast service, and the food is delicious. The chicken and waffles are one of the best in town.
Tried this place. Not my favorite. Food wasn't what I expected. Soup (Tomato Basil) was warm, not hot. It tasted a bit too tart. The grilled cheese was not melted. People were friendly. However, I don't think I will make a trip to go there again.
Back again second time this week trying out the black and bleu burger brought the mrs. Service fantastic as last time .. Greeted from the moment you walk in... The mrs loves it said the food I recommended (MTO breakfast) is great ... Awesome place
I have enjoyed 2 lunches here and  today I really enjoyed the avocado omelot and the pancakes that were amazing. The service is always excellent. Prices are a bit steep, but all the restaurants at Downtown Summerlin are. I feel that the food here is worth the price.
Not impressed. It definitely was not worth what you pay for it. It wasn't  terrible, but the food and smoothies were bland. I feel like I could have gone somewhere a little cheaper and gotten the same or better meal. Underwhelmed and unsatisfied.
My son's grilled cheese was obscenely greasy, my turkey burger was fine but had none of the pickled jalapeno the menu said was included. Both of our fries were cold. The cashier was rude, rushed and asked 3 times if the "go go squeeze" on my son's stroller tray was from their restaurant. Sorry honey, but I have better things to do than steal an applesauce from your mediocre restaurant. The breakfasts looked huge and delish - maybe if we had chosen different food, I would be happier with my experience. But between the overpriced lunch, the rude cashier and the greasy grilled cheese, I'll probably pass on MTO next time. =(
New spot to try lunch was great new England clam chowder was amazing had the turkey melt and that was yummy also will come again to try more super yummy and great outside seating
Oh my gosh! I've died and gone to heaven! Chicken and waffles are the best! So glad it's a block from home! Never thought I'd see the day this mall and restaurants would be here!
I'm not entirely sure why this place has such good reviews. My girlfriend and I went here and ordered the seasonal berry waffles and the chicken and waffles. These were the blandest waffles I've ever had. The berries were fresh and the vanilla whip cream wasn't overly sweet which was a good thing. The chicken was cooked nicely but the gravy once again was entirely too bland. Why? If I'm paying 35$ for two orders of waffles they better be good. But what do you expect in downtown Summerlin I suppose. My next complaint is the staff. Between the 3 cashiers that all look as if they hate their job to the busser that sags his pants I'm not sure where to go from here. They have 8-9 staff members working for four tables, I'm also not sure how this business model is working for them but if they continue I'm sure they won't be in business for much longer. At least I hope not considering I don't want other people to also get ripped off. To the owner: Reevaluate.
Loved the Tree Hugger quinoa patties and greens for brunch! Delicious and healthy! Very quick service too!
Great food...super expensive for a cafe! I will absolutely return in spite of the higher prices.
Cool place.  The food is unique and really good.  I had lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote.  Yum!  The restaurant has bright colors and modern design...very clean.  I think it is overpriced, however, I will return for the pancakes.
I'm not one to complain about prices when the quality is in line with what is charged, however mto at Downtown Summerlin is outright ridiculous.
It's just too overpriced for how below mediocre the quality is. Even if it was moderately priced it's still not good food in my opinion. I had a burger and would have preferred any of the basic burger places to it. It's got a good idea (business model wise) but I don't know why they think they can charge that much money for how bland their food is. I didn't like the downtown location either.
Way too overpriced!! The food was...eh...good. I had the broccoli omelette. It was ok. It came with the omelette and about 4 sprigs of lettuce. Was that a generous side portion? The omelette was $11...come on, really? It was not that serious of an omelette to get away with charging that. My daughter had the kids pancake. It was loaded with chocolate chips, powdered sugar and a red mystery gel. It was good but not for what they charged. All in I spent $30. I don't mind paying for quality OR quantity but this place was clearly neither. The atmosphere was nice and staff was nice. I will definitely not be back nor do I recommend this place. There are better spots to get food from with better portions and quality.
Food is great but the service is amazing from the moment you get on the door a welcoming hello and smiling faces!!!
Stopped in here on a busy Saturday afternoon and ordered the BLTAE. While the sandwich itself was delicious and the open faced presentation lovely, it was quite difficult to eat. It would have been much better had the sandwich not been served open faced. Putting the sandwich together was messy and because the plates have no rims/lips, the egg yolk leaked off the plate and onto the table. 
So, my husband, daughter and I escaped out last Saturday evening for a quick bite to eat at Downtown Summerlin.  I had seen some great things about MTO Cafe on Yelp and through Instagram and suggested we give it a try as we were going for something quick and easy.  We each ordered a salad and split a side of fries(I know kind of an oxymoron, but this was concidered a cheat meal).  We decided to sit on the patio, as I always love the option to do so.  We made our way out and had a seat.
Love the food here.  It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for - high quality food with great flavor.  I took off a star because many of the soda choices were out of stock and the kids cheese burger was overcooked and the bun was hard.
I stopped by this cafe for the first time this weekend for a good cup of coffee.   I had to stand on line that was out the door for a long time as there was only ONE person to take orders, work the ccash computer and serve people coffee and small items.   I got a small plain watered down cup of coffee from a hand pump caraf and was charged $3.25 for the bad coffee and bad experience.  Very disappointing and certainly no desire to ever return.
Food was ok but incredibly overpriced for a counter service restaurant. MTO breakfast was good. Lemon poppyseed pancakes were quite dry and had no lemon flavor.
This place has the best clam chowder I've ever had in my life!!! Their BLT sandwich is awesome too (it's made with egg and avocado, you have to try it). Unfortunately their cookies are not up to par, but they have this amazing granola called "Rooster Boy" that's the best granola I've ever tasted.
MTO was so incredible. We got the fat Elvis, chicken and waffle, wings, blue burger, and the Mac and cheese. The establishment is so cute it's like a order and sit down restaurant like a Panera bread style. The food is soooooo good and huge portions for the price. It was only 60$ for all of our amazing food. I will be back!!! The staff were very helpful and friendly.
With the resturant having more than half of the tables empty,  a line out the door waiting to order.... 
Ordered a Broccoli and Avocado Skillet with a side order of Bacon and waited over 30minutes for our meal. Had to walk up to the counter to inquire about order twice and was told they had a computer glitch. Everyone else who ordered after me received their order and left the premise before we finally got our meal. I was very disappointed and would not eat there or recommend this establishment. A restaurant manager tried to remedy the situation with fried doughnuts but that didn't do the trick in my book! Meal Should've been refunded!
If I could just say Hangover burger and have the completed review, I would do so, but for the integrity of Yelp, I will write something a little more detailed.
This place is great!! From the service to the food you can't go wrong!! The Hangover Burger was to die for. It was super juicy and the flavors were on point! The manager Chris made sure we were taken care of from the time we walked in to the time we left. I will definitely be coming back very soon!
Well well well... I'll have to start off by saying it sucks for MTO (or any business) to have to deal with getting 3 stars or less from people who do not know how restaurants work, oh and the ones who can't cook to save their own lives, oh and definitely the ones who all they know is Chili's and that $6.99 prime rib dinner at the Cannery!! Then they get on sites like Yelp and speak like they know what they are talking about... People! People! .... Stop wasting everyone's time by giving businesses 2 stars because it was too packed and you had to wait longer! What do you want these places to do, something is obviously going right if the place is packed! Or giving them 3 stars because the food was good, but they got your order wrong the first time and that pissed you off but you didn't say anything when that restaurant sends out a free dessert item! You people are annoying, lame, and disgruntled.
Very dissappinted in service. My boyfriend and I are vegan and specifically came here because another vegan told us of their great experience. I saw that some items on the menu could be made vegan upon request. I ordered the tomato basil soup which came with a grilled cheese - all vegan. We also ordered a falafel sandwich. When the soup and grilled cheese arrived, the grilled cheese looked a little suspicious. I asked if it was vegan, and the woman said no, they don't have vegan cheese. They had no answer when we asked why a non-vegan side would come with a vegan item on the menu. Instead of rectifying their own mistake, we were offered two toothpicks with three small pieces of fruit. The manager said that's "the best" he could do. 
This should have been covered in business 101 but when your recording says you're open till 9 stay open till 9! Drove down arrived at 8:25 to find out you close at 8 ... Won't be back
I've been here twice already and have enjoyed both my meals very much! I've had the hen house wrap and it tasted very fresh, loved it. Today I tried the Chicken in a waffle, asked for it without the gravy and it was so delicious! I ate it so quickly!  The only reason I say a 4 rather than a 5 is because it's more on the pricey side, but it's reasonable =)
My fiancé and I moved to Vegas 2.5 months ago, and discovered MTO Café quickly upon our arrival. Nestled in the beautiful Downtown Summerlin, we were thrilled to find this delicious restaurant/take-out style café where you don't have to wait for table service, yet get to sit back and enjoy an awesome (comfort) meal.
Would not reccomend. Overpriced avereage food coupled with a very strange ordering system and a return trip is not in the cards. 
Lemon poppyseed pancakes were good.  Kentucky fried chicken ok, pretty dry.  Salt and pepper fries yum. My son had the cheeseburger it was ok.  Overall good but I would like to give it another try since the menu is full of things that sound so good and hopefully it will be more impressive next time.
Was hungry during lunch hours so why not brunch right? Passed this place numerous times located in Downtown Summerlin, me and wifey decided to go check it out. The minute me and wifey walked in we were greeted loudly "welcome to MTO Cafe!"
I had the chicken skillet and the red juice! Both were delicious. I prefer the red juice over the green juice but both are good. The staff was very friendly.
This was my first time here and staff was very friendly and very helpful telling us about the menu. We ordered breakfast. Everything tastes very fresh and well cooked. Big portions. I can't wait to go back again.
Second time to eat at this location and was not as happy as last visit. Prices are expensive for the amount of food you get and I think it's wrong for the machine to ask for a tip as you pay on the register before even getting food or service. It's self serve so basically why am I tipping, it's also tacky to leave a tip jar at the register when they only bring your food to your table as drinks and everything else is self serve. I don't see other restaurants asking for tips for the kitchen staff.
I'm a fan of MTO's Downtown location and the Downtown Summerlin spin off doesn't disappoint either. Their version of Kentucky fried chicken ($13) is similar in name only to the fast food spot with the same name. The chicken here has a thick, well seasoned crust that virtually cracks open. With two eggs over easy, mash browns, and country gravy, this is one of the better breakfast dishes around. Other breakfast dishes are well crafted, like the chorizo skillet and you can't go wrong with the bacon dippers --strips of bacon covered in pancake batter.
I prefer their other location but still delicious healthy food. I have never had something I didn't like here. I enjoy the honey walnut sandwich but my sisters breakfast plate was also delicious! Nice area to walk around after and have some ice cream and shop. This was a side of Vegas I had not explored previously and I enjoyed how local it felt.
Have been to MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin a few times now. 
Place was super clean and inviting but prices were way too much for their servings. My family had the breakfast and my omelet was nicely seasoned but small, small salad on side with no dressing for over $11.00? BabyStacks cafe blows away their breakfast food menu and pricing for the amount of serving.
We had the bacon pancake dippers and mac and cheese. Food was really good. Atmosphere is cozy. All employees were super friendly. Great place for comfort food!
I have been going to there location in downtown Las Vegas, and was really excited to hear they opened up in downtown summerlin. Food is always on point along with service!
I've only had a few items here and they've all been really good. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I don't think I've had enough of the menu to say everything is great. Have been with a few friends and they got lunch items and said it was good but nothing spectacular. 
Best place to go to when you want that breakfast in my pictures I'm showing the MTO breakfast and my 1st time trying chicken and waffles ... 1st bite is unbelievable ... Young Lee is the man!
This is a good place for a lunch or late breakfast before a day of shopping. I really like their chicken skillet with egg whites. It's pretty healthy and really flavorful.
Fantastic for lunch or snacks. Varied menu with interesting flavors and colorful presentation. Staff are extremely friendly without being annoying. The entire place is very well managed. Service is prompt. Food is served fresh from the kitchen so expect hot food to be hot and fresh. Highly recommended.
This was my first visit with my girlfriend to a restaurant here in at the mall. We're giving all of the restaurants in the new mall a try, and so far by far this Café is #1 by far compared to my previous dining. This guy in a zebra shirt recommended the chicken in a waffle and their hangover burger. Both were fantastic. Later he came back and talked to us and we found out the nice guy was a manager....I'm coming back for that zebra shirt btw haha. He was very friendly, the register girl was very friendly, and the atmosphere was friendly. Will definitely try again after my tour of the mall.
This review is for their Cappuccinos and Lattes 
Great little place to grab a quick bite! Very fresh and customer service is great!!  Prices a little steep for  portions, definitely would be back..
Price is steep for the give service. Food was ok, we ordered two of the MTO's breakfast which seed like spam and eggs. Not too happy with the service
Definitely overpriced for what you get! I had gotten the hangover burger to go for my daughter before and my two bites of it were great so we returned to try it again as well as other things. Also, I had read an interview with some local chef who raved about the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote. As another reviewer noted, the pancakes were super dry and devoid of any flavor and there was no discernible ginger flavor in the compote. Very disappointing. My daughter's tomato basil soup was just so so, bit too thick for my taste, and I didn't bother tasting her grilled cheese. The hangover burger was just ok, nothing special. The patty has some good beefy flavor but other than not, not worth the price tag. I never mind paying for great taste and quality, but don't like getting gouged for mediocre food. I will not be returning....
If you're looking for awesome food and a fun relaxing environment, this is the place to be. The employees here are amazing! Shelby, Trevor, & Amber shine way above the rest, they are the reason me and my wife keep coming back, aside from the amazing food that is. Keep up the great work guys!
Went in for lunch today with my family. I'm not opposed to the fast casual concept but this place was priced for full service. I had a simple grilled cheese sandwich (can't eat Brie so I ordered the kids version). My daughter had the kids pancake. $7 for ONE pancake with no sides. Husband had a sandwich and we all had fountain drinks and our bill was $36. We could've eaten somewhere much nicer for that price. Food was mediocre at best. We won't be back.
Christine is very pleasant and kind! She was super friendly and patient as my mom and I were trying to decide what to get. The other employees are also very pleasant and courteous. The food was fresh and flavorful. I love that they use organic chicken. Definitely a bonus. Great atmosphere and great location!
We visited this location since we know the MTO brand from our visits to the downtown location. When I walked in to this MTO I felt lost I felt like it wasn't MTO which completely defeated the purpose of me going to visit a brand I already know.
This was an expensive 18.00 sandwich, and it fell apart.  Was mushy as well.  Parking in Downtown Summerlin was a disaster.
THE BOB
I enjoyed food and place a lot , love the menu, tried chicken and waffle ,was delicious I will came back for sure
Love MTO. Friendly staff, and several delicious options to choose from. Good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Be sure to check it out if you're around Downtown Summerlin.
Having been to the original location Downtown I was relatively confident that I would enjoy this location as well, I we wrong. We came here for breakfast today, my mom ordered the Kentucky fried chicken and eggs and I ordered the tri tip and eggs with toasted brioche. 
Food was just okay (big portions though). My food came out 20 minutes before my husbands which was lame. Also, we both used $5 off coupons we had received from a friend and come to find out after we left they had only taken $1 off my husbands bill and $3 off of mine. That is unacceptable and sneaky.
Definitely a fan of MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin! My husband and I stopped in for brunch today for the first time. I really liked it - I thought the food was delicious and I really like that it's walk up rather than table service. It's nice if you're not feeling like cooking breakfast at home, but you also don't want to wait for service all morning on a busy Sunday at a restaurant. 
Located in the heart of Summerlin, mto Cafe wasn't quite what I expected. This restaurant is a blend of "do-it-yourself" dining, some healthy juices, basic wraps and omelettes and table-side cleanup. You have to get your own silverware, salt and pepper, napkins and beverages which are dispensed from something you might have imagined seeing on the Jetson's. The food was ok. Not bad but nothing to rave about. If you want a full service meal, mto Cafe is not your best choice. But the food was ok and the price was reasonable.
I was very happy to meet some of your staff this past Tuesday at the Shelby Museum event! The burger with the Quail egg was AWESOME! We live right up the street and plan on visiting your Downtown Summerlin location very soon.
Why the HELL did I not come here sooner??? DAMN..sustainable organic whatever,man..it's still DAMN good!! Amber took the time to explain the menu, sign ups,etc and Allison and Trevor were a delight..I got the Vegan falafel and my daughter got chicken and waffles and all I can say is HELLA GOOD!! And they're playing kick ass music...all kinds of peeps here. ..I'm digging on this place..
-Fresh high quality ingredients
Very rarely do I give 5 stars, I'm pretty picky. This place rocks! It's clean, the chairs are so comfy and the customer service is outstanding. Now to the food, I ordered a Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast and it was delicious. Boyfriend got a berry waffle that he loved. At first I thought the prices were a little high, but totally worth it. Quality and taste is perfect. Can't wait to come back and try another dish.
I went here over a week ago.  I am still dreaming about my return to have the Hangover Burger once again.   It is TDF.  This is a two handed burger that is indulgently mess...juices running down your arm, about a dozen napkins needed. The egg was perfectly cooked...oozy warm yolk, medium burger cooked medium (yeah!), good sturdy but soft bun (which I don't eat, but gives structure), I believe quality Tillamook Cheddar for a little tang and more unchousness? (sp).  
After sampling a Hangover Burger at the Redline Rendezvous YEE, I looked forward to going to the new MTO Cafe to try more of its offerings at the source.  So, Diane and I met another couple there to do just that.
I've ate at both locations now, the downtown & downtown summerlin location.. Food is great.. a little overpriced for the portions, but so yummy.. I tried the fat elvis & also the bacon pancake dippers.. soo good.. :P
Interesting place for Breakfast in Downtown Summerlin this past Sunday (Nov 8)! More of a Fast Food process for ordering, then they give you table a number and deliver the food to you. Drinks were self-served 
Decided to try somewhere new on my day off while walking around Downtown Summerlin. MTO cafe was perfect! Fun, friendly atmosphere.  Food was fresh and cooked to order. I had the Avocado Egg Skillet which is a scramble of eggs, red onion, jalapeño jack cheese & tomatillo sauce, topped with fresh avocado. It's what's under the scramble that makes it so yummy....a nest of their signature potatoes.  They are thinly sliced shoestring type and cooked to perfection!
We've been in twice now for lunch. This place is nice! It's got a neat patio and we've had nice service on both occasions. 
Don't try to order off the kids menu unless you can prove you have a child with you. I wanted plain chicken fingers and they don't offer it on the regular menu. Also, I wasn't feeling well enough for a full meal of something else. They wouldn't let me get chicken fingers. Clearly they don't understand that some adults have health issues and can only eat certain foods and/or smaller portions. My husband ordered a burger and a drink. Totaled $17. I really don't think my $7 overpriced, kids chicken fingers should have been a big deal. I am now waiting for Blue Ribbon to open at 11am so I can go get some chicken fingers. I'm sure they will be glad to take my $7+. At many restaurants, I often order from the kids menu when I am not feeling well. NEVER have I been denied food. I always make sure to order a drink and my husband gets a full priced meal to make up the difference. This place just has bad customer service and I won't be back. It's really unfortunate, because I have enjoyed their food in the past. Oh well. Time for some Blue Ribbon !
Don't get this 3 star review twisted. I really like this place. The food is very tasty, the staff is always friendly and this location has a cute outdoor patio. I would give this place a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the prices. 
Ugh, I want to love you! I had good experience at the MTO downtown but as pretty as this place is, it failed so bad on just my coffee. Which is sacred to me. It was cold and windy and there MTO was in all its orange glory. I walked in, was greeted with great smiles and ordered a simple latte. Like I said, I dined at the MTO downtown so I was ready to enjoy this coffee when it tasted like steamed milk. I popped to the top off to see what it looked like steamed milk with a splash espresso. The color was so wrong and so was the purchase. I brought it back to have one remade and again, although slightly better - it wasn't what it should be. So anyway....
I was WOWed by the food here.  I had the daily special 'Black Chicken', simple dish but it was incredible, cooked perfectly and full of flavor.
The hen house wrap with smash Browns instead of fries is all I need from this place.  Bomb.
I haven't put a bite of food in my mouth yet but I rated this restaurant one star just because the cashier he took our order LITERALLY rolled her eyes the entire time my kids and I gave her our order. First and last time I eat here.
This has been my go to  burger spot whenever I'm on the summerlin side of town. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and I'm never disappointed. It always feels like you are given a never ending amount of fries(which is awesome!) The cashier people are always nice and ready to get your order.  4/5 because there have been times where the fries felt hard like rocks.
Their food is amazing !!!!! I got the French toast & my boyfriend got the Kentucky fried chicken. Both were so good. This might be our new fave breakfast spot now :) & the atmosphere is so mellow & calm & the staff seemed pretty nice & we didn't have to wait too long for our food , we are here on a Sunday & it's not even packed which is more than perfect !
If I could leave 0 stars I would. This is the third time they have either totally forgotten my order or gotten it wrong. I waited 25 minutes for my order only to be told they must have lost it and hadn't even started it. And I barely even got an apology or a refund for an order that did t exist. Go anywhere else.
This is one of those places where you can get food and feel healthy about it.  Typically these kind of places aren't cheap.  
It's been a very long time since I've had food that just doesn't do anything for me. There is no shtick, no wow, no pizzazz. Well, maybe the uncomfortable aftertaste that lingered longer than I'd like to admit. The service was ho-hum, not bad, not good or great. I guess you could say that there approach is food is fuel, not fun or enjoyable. I guess you could say the options in Vegas have left me jaded and this isn't going to hold up to the competition.
This is our go-to place. Everything we've had has been excellent. From the hangover burger, to chicken and waffles, to fat elvis, to falafel wrap. 
We are here at least twice a week. Kid friendly and all the girls are super nice and patient with my little one (and his never ending requests for more orange slices). Have never had a bad experience and hope it stays that way. Food comes out fast and always as we ordered it. Favorites include the avocado skillet and the falafel wrap. Always steady but quiet. This is my go-to for a quick weekday dinner when I'm not in the mood to cook! Hope you guys are here forever!
To make a long review short, this place is fantastic. The food, portions, and quality are all reasonable for the price. The avocado skillet, the vegan pancakes, and the BLTAE are out of this world. Oh, and another great thing about this place is their customer service. All of the employees are such a charm. Amber, Allyson and Lilly are really attentive. Their customer service blows my mind. 
I had the Chorizo skillet and my wife had the Teriyaki Turkey Burger on a lettuce wrap. Food was flavorful but was lukewarm. Mine wasn't cooked in the skillet that it was served in. Good place, good ambience, just would request that the food be served hotter.
Went here for breakfast for the first time today with my family and It was absolutely the best. Everything was fresh and hot. Pancakes to die for. The atmosphere was so nice. I highly recommend this lovely place.
On Feb 15. My husband and I went to MTO Cafe and ordered a pastry and a latte. 10 minutes later our pastry was brought to us hard and cooling because some parts were warm which told me it had been sitting too long. After seeing 7 other customers who came after us get their latter's over 20 minutes of waiting the guy brought my husband his latte. Don't get me wrong, the gentleman was very polite and the order taker was a sweet lady but the organization is as different as night and day between morning and afternoon. We've been to MTO Cafe a dozen times in the morning and the service has been friendly, organized, and fast. The 2 times we have gone around 4pm has been a perfect "How Not To Run A Restaurant Cafe/Kitchen" play book. Oh and incase you think I'm lying, my TICKET #25 @ 4:54pm.
Service is great and they have healthy choices as well as not so healthy choices, my wife loves the tree hugger plate and I like the skillets
This is one of my favorite breakfast places!  The Chicken in a Waffle, and the Kentucky Fried Chicken!  Always so good, fresh, and worth the drive from south Vegas!  We come every week! S/O to Amber - she's always super friendly, and has great customer service :)
I came here for an afternoon snack while strolling summerlin. It's a clean cafè, however, doesn't give any impression from the outside. But as they always say, "don't judge the book by its cover". That's what I did and nothing did change.
Love this place! I find myself craving it all the time after trying their Turkey Melt (with their house salad as a substitute for fries) and their Body Builder skillet! Both are fantastic and a must try! Wish they closed later since their menu could definitely be great for dinner - who says you can't have breakfast/brunch food for dinner?! Haha definitely try MTO when you are at DTS! :)
This is a great place to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner while shopping at DT Summerlin. Their menu has great variety, and they are incredibly consistent with the quality.
The turkey melt and the avocado skillet are my favorites here. The wait is a little long even when it seems no one else is there eating, but the food is always fresh and filling. A little expensive, but worth it in a pinch. Staff members are always wiping down tables and offering to take empty plates, and always greet me when I walk in the door. They have one of those cool Coke machines where you pick exactly what you want, too. Added bonus because I love me some Cherry Vanilla Coke.
Chicken in a Waffle ($13): Country gravy and fries. Great waffles and delicious fried chicken strips.
After walking in,  you go to the counter to place your order. They serve breakfast all day. For lunch there are salads, sandwiches,  wraps and more. Also a small kids menu that is reasonably priced. We shared the $13 Reuben. It came with a choice of fries or a small salad. My grandchildren shared a grilled cheese sandwich off the kids menu. We chose to have it served with apple slices ( there were five very tiny apple slices - even for a kids menu side dish, this was a small portion)
Great place to eat ! I love their healthy yet comforting menu and I go their atleast 3 times a month! Last time I was there I found a hair in my ketchup and I kindly took it back and and asked for a new one ! I think the hair was from the servers not the cooks.
Was in Vegas for a whole week, best place to have brunch around. I have done buffets, top end places and  places like these. Wait staff is great, food is great, and the music was on point. I wished they had a location in my home town. For all you brunch couples out there. This place is a must. Easy to park , great for a mid day meal.
Been wanting to try this place for a while. It reminds me of Rachel's Kitchen. It is a little bit expensive, but if a little money isn't an issue, then the food itself can hold up against a little scrutiny. The ingredients seemed fresh enough and the taste was good. I would go back again since it feels a bit healthier and quicker than some of the other options around.
Nice spring lunch was enjoyed here today. Spring in Vegas means wind and this afternoon it was whipping so much patio dining was out of the question. Boo!
I enjoy having breakfast here once in a while. They have plenty of healthy options. I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots, pecans, and agave syrup, along with the veggie hash with egg whites. The veggie hash is served in a skillet. Both are excellent. I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, potatoes, and whole wheat toast. You definitely won't be disappointed with your meal.
I heard so much good stuff about MTO's downtown location. I don't know how this location compares, but I'm thinking that downtown must be better. The food is mediocre I ordered a Ceaser salad today the croutons were bomb the dressing had the consistency and taste of Helmans mayo, and it seems they used a low grade parmesian cheese. 
Food is great, for a pretty good price! Not the best brunch in Las Vegas, but definitely one of the best if you're not looking to be downtown and deal with busy crowds. All staff including the manager was extremely friendly! The great vibe and energy alone are what keeps me going back!
Food is delicious!!! Their menu is awesome and the service is wonderful!!! Their cronut burger is amazing!!! And they give large portions! Mac n cheese is to die for!!! We'll definitely be back!!!
Food"s so fresh and fabulous! Great casual place to eat with the friendliest staff! Kelly is awesome! Coming back with my dog next time!
MTO Cafe never disappoints! One of my favorite dishes has to be the KFC. Can't go wrong with county gravy, chicken and eggs! 
Lovely atmosphere.. :)
MTO is amazing! We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in and the pretty redhead cashier, Noelle, didn't rush us while we took a few minutes to look at the huge menu. She suggested the chicken and quinoa salad which was so good! She even checked on us while we were eating to make sure we liked everything, and brought us our silverware when we forgot to grab some after ordering. I can't wait to go back there again!
Great service loved the turkey melt! Lacie and Hanna helped me out and were very friendly. Went to cream after, love the location and the atmosphere inside the restaurant!
Definitely my new go-to brunch spot and a hidden gem in Downtown Summerlin. Everyone there is so sweet and smiling. Alyson recommended me the avocado skillet and it was amazing! Love the mash browns that go with it. I would recommend going on a weekday since they get pretty busy on the weekends. Either way, great service and delicious food!
I had the steak and eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the steak was cooked medium rare like I ordered.  All the staff was great giving energy to the restaurant.   The only drawback is that they  did not have a steak knife to cut the steak.   Other than that  everything was fantastic.
Very disappointed in my $14 hamburger that I waited 30m for. Staff seems put out. Food was average. Tables outside weren't cleaned promptly so birds were flocking. Won't be back.
1 star because the service by the blonde snotty teenage cashier really made me & my boyfriend's experience here poor.  I had to greet her, she looked annoyed that she had to help another customer, and my questions were answered with short, blunt, minimal answers. Needless to say she didn't assist me with anything other than taking my money. Good thing she doesn't work on tips! Food was pretty good, but then I just saw them on Dirty Dining this evening eeeeekkkk! So now I;m seriously not going back. Crappy service and demerits for cleanliness? No thanks.
Reminded me of a Panera with slightly nicer ingredients. Never better breakfast selection and lunch and they marry their ketchup so watch out
Cheap price but large value, the potatoes taste amazing! 
Great Hummus!  If you're at the Jean Talon market, make sure you stop by for some great vegetarian food.  The place was clean and prices are reasonable.  I'm from NYC and was in town for a couple of days.  It was the best hummus I had in Montreal.  And free wifi as well, which was greatly needed since I was out of my network. I regret I didn't try the roasted potatoes or rice and lentils...they looked really good.
Nourriture pourrie. Tomates aucunement fraiches. Worst lebanese food i've ever tasted in my life.
i was in the mood for some poutine, shawarma poutine to be exact and instead of going to a more safer choice, decided to head down to the market for some franchised lebanese.. truth be told, should have not.
Great middle eastern food and the quality is spot on.  I had the chicken and Shawerma combo plate.  The beef and chicken are both lean and tender.  Potatoes and rice very well cooked.
Eat here! This place looks like nothing special from the outside, and is essentially a cafeteria-style joint with several pre-set options on a lit board above the counter, but the food is awesome! 
Falafels should be freshly deep-fried at the time of your order. 
I came here when my normal Starbucks was filled with so many first day holiday drink and gift shoppers that I decided not to wait at my normal stop.  I had remembered it mentioned that there was a Starbucks at Macy's and I decided to give it a try.
The staff was understaffed and they STILL took care of everyone flawlessly they were polite and efficient definitely coming back great drinks too I got a chestnut praline latte Sooooo good
horrible. starbucks wasnt on the directory so for me who has never bern here before i couldnt find it. oh but its inside macys. a drink was still $5.50 for crap. only ended up drinking half of it soo gross
Prices are very high at this Starbucks. It also is not at a good location at downtown Summerlin. It should have its own store front. It's always very crowded and they've gotten my drink wrong twice.
Coffee to me isn't just a drink it's a lifestyle. Regrettably, this insignificant Starbuck's inside of Macy's is the exclusive coffee house to satisfy the coffee lovers lifestyle in Downtown Summerlin 
I was there last night with my friend from 7:30pm to closing , 8:30pm I guess is their closing time. Had a really bad experience with the baristas . The Hispanic barista who helped us at te counter was so rude to not explain thoroughly about one of our order. On their board it says green tea and white tea , that being said we thought it's a combination of both, but instead the other guy barista said "oh it's a typo, don't know why it's even there," what a poor customer service. Me and my friend were still thinking abot the order and the girl barista's like "huh?". Wow! Is that a way to ask a customer about an order? We let all of it pass, we just proceed with our tea lattes and a dessert and hanged out. A Hispanic girl, black guy and a white guy barista on duty that night. The girl and the white boy was flirting with each other whenever there's no one on their counter to order. Here comes 8:30pm, the white boy came to us and said "we're closed."
Took my three boys here for their holiday haircuts. Walked in looking shaggy and walked out looking like male models!  Excellent job with the kids and very family friendly. Angelo was there and did a fine job. I would recommend to anyone!!!  
Cuts for me and 3 sons.  Much better than that sports place - these guys actually know how to blend a cut!  Actually, that's not given them enough credit.  It had been way too long for all of us, but we all walked out with best haircut in years.  
Angelo's is the best "old school" barber shop in Gilbert, maybe the whole East Valley. The shop is easy to find, clean and the warm reception I got as a new customer was exceptional. After my cut, my wife said, wow, you look like a new man! Lucky me, thanks to Angelo. He used to own an Italian Restaurant in Maryland, so if you enjoy good food, he's got some good stories. "Try it, You'll  Like It"
Another great flat top at Angelos.  This is my Third visit, and I am completely satisfied with my haircut. The atmosphere is relaxed, and friendly. This place reminds me of the old fashioned barbershop that my dad would take me to. If you are interested in the flat top, ask for Angelo himself. He is the best at it. The other barbers do a great job as well. When they are finishing, they use this massager on your scalp, neck, shoulders, and arms. It is very relaxing.  This place is the best, I won't go anywhere else.
Great place to get a hair cut definitely my new barber shop great barbers good cuts thanks for making me look fresh
Awesome great barber shop!! Very friendly barbers and also kid friendly!! Highly recommended for a barber shop! Definitely will return!! However the only downfall is to make sure you bring cash when you come; they do not take any cards!!
Walked in with my son to get haircuts and we weren't greeted in any way.  Both barbers on duty looked up at us, but didn't acknowledge us whatsoever.  Would like to have been told how long of a wait or how many people were ahead of us, but got nothing....not even a "hello".  They only accept cash (huh?).
These guys are awesome. Each barber has a specific style so try them all and then stick with the one you like but they're each VERY good at their respective styles.
I just had one of the worst experiences of my life at Angelo's Barber shop #2 in Gilbert, Az. It wasn't with my haircut. The owner is about a 70 yr old Italian man. He was born and raised there and came to America 40 yrs ago. My barber Bianca is a Latin female and is awesome. As she is cutting my hair, we were having a conversation in Spanish. After a while he yells out this is America, speak English! I of course kept speaking Spanish. I was boiling but kept calm. Anyway there was a couple & their 3 sons waiting to get their hair cut and we're speaking in another language. I asked them what language they were speaking and they said Portuguese. I told them to be careful as they might be asked to shut up. Angelo the owner didn't say a dam thing. This is the same guy that when the old school Italians come in, he chats it up in his Italian language. It's his shop I get it and he can do what he wants. But to me that's hipocrisy. I was so disgusted with this after 4 years of supporting this barber shop, I shook all of the barbers hands and told them that was that last time I would go to that barber shop. The sad thing is that I was the 5th person this week that experienced this. According to the barbers anyway. I'm an American Citizen and I can speak whatever language I want to. Isn't this the home of the brave and the land of the free? All I know is that prejudice/racism is alive and well. Just because you don't go through this shitty experience, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Be mindful of others. Be the best you, you can possibly be. Even when nobody's watching. Don't forget where you came from people. We are all from somewhere, so get off your freaken high horse's and be good to others. How is this for my good Friday!
This is the real deal.  Angelo is the best barber I've met. He doesn't put up with bull though.  Amazing place and person
Good place for carne Asad fries. Only beans and Pico de Gallo are not offered with the plate you have to get those separately if you wish. Great Aguas frescas ( jamaica and horchata)
Tried a carne asada taco, wasn't anything special. The guy behind the counter was pretty nice but I think he was doing everything himself! Taking orders from both the counter and drive thru and I think he was doing the cooking too! I might give it another try just to give something else a try but honestly don't have my hopes up too high.
bigger is better the burritos & combos make the other places look like kids meals...great food super!
Food was always good when it was Ubaldo's Taco Shop. It's even better now that it is Rosendo's Taco Shop. The food, the menu, the  ordering process, and wait time are all much better now.
The food is delicious. Reasonably priced. The restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and organizing. It looks like they gave up in the middle of a remodel or repair. The girl at the counter was very sweet. 
I was very impressed with Touchstone Gallery. While I'm not the kind who can afford the larger pieces, I was impressed with both the high quality of mineral specimens used and the creative elegance. You'd be surprised how many other stores & galleries can take beautiful rocks and minerals and make awkward or unattractive furnishings. That was not a problem here.
Gorgeous presentation of fossils, petrified wood and minerals! Walking into this gallery was treat. It is a naturalist's haven. The store is well organized and all items were beautifully displayed. My favorite pieces were the fish fossils that look like that they were paintings. The geodes displayed were also lovely. The jewelry for sale was also exquisite. I can't wait to visit and purchase a piece or two to showcase in our classroom. Prices are a little on the higher side, but you get what you pay.
I drove from Chandler to shop & the store is closed before 4pm. It looked nice from the window.
Love this store!  Great selection of high quality and name brand clothes and accessories.  You can get nearly new for less than half the price.
I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the store was, clean and very organized.. it is a bit of a drive for me, but after going there, I wouldn't go to any other store.. I usually feel smothered at other stores, not here. According to my kids,, they have everything that's in fashion today.lol
I absolutely love this place. Everything is displayed beautifully and items are priced very reasonable for all parties involved as it is a consignment store. The employees are very nice and friendly and the owner is amazing.  I help the homeless by passing out items and she donates to the cause:)  So really this shop is a win win for all involved. NOTHING GOES TO WASTE. so if you are looking to buy or consigner please go check Twice A Round out.  CALL FOR STORE HOURS JUST IN CASE.
I love this shop! They have such nice things and great prices. Twice around consignment is a little gem of a shop.
Great training for kids and adults!
If you are looking for physical conditioning this gym provides that and more. My grandchildren have been trained by coach June Bug and they have not only learned Marshal Arts skills but also have learned  the benefits of discipline and hard work. Coach June Bug is a skilled and encouraging coach. All ages are welcome.
Great.
I recently enrolled my two kids at the 9th Isle BJJ due to the professionalism, hard working attitudes & dedication of the instructors and the student in all ranks. Both my kids already had some martial arts experience in the past & I wanted to kick it up a notch by getting them into BJJ. I know this was a great choice & looking forward towards the future. I love it & my kids do too. I highly recommend this studio if you have what it takes to be a quality fighter in this game. Not everyone will be a Champions. Here you will earn it. They have a wall to prove it.
Some of the most humble and nicest trainers( and classmates) I've met. They work with you regardless of what you skill level is. Classes are kept small, therefore you learn much more in detail while the instructor is constantly giving great tips and tricks, almost one-on-one, while training. Great atmosphere, everyone is family there and they welcome new comers as one of their own!
We just loved Louie. He has started some work for us and he like family. I'm so excited to work with Louie. He the man! Knows he plants. Patient with all our questions. His work is amazing.
AWFUL EXPERIENCE with the owner Louie Maldonado and the work that was done in my yard.
Not sure how this company holds an A+ rating with the bbb. I've had nothing but problems since day one. I will say the yard clean up went well but when I contracted for monthly service, they failed. They didn't trim the shrubs per our agreement and when I called to inform them so they could come back and correct the situation. ...I was ignored. No response period. So two weeks later i get ahold of them and they said they would not return to address the issues until next week. Needless to say...I fired them.
Very disappointed in this company! We thought they were going to be a good company to work with as the owner is very nice, personable and seemed very attentive. Turns out, they're like many out there that do what they can to get your business and then it all goes to... Well you know!  Time to start over and find someone who truly wants our business.
We started off well. We got a one time yard clean up and landscape lighting replaced - This went very well. After which the service gradually went bad. As it turns out the service is farmed out to another crew and I was never told about this. When I called to cancel my service with "Desert Landscape and Pools", they did not return my call/email nor did they have the courtesy to take care of the closing of the account. I was asked to call the people doing my yard and close out my account myself. I wont use them again.
First and foremost let me just say I love this place!! Chow time is amazing. The food is great and the people who work their are terrific. It's not your normal food truck the food is always freshly made and has the most amazing taste from the Chipotle burger to their pulled pork sandwiches everything is seasoned amazingly. The owner and his family really put everything they have into serving you the best BBQ. As long as you don't mind having a seat outside close the food truck where you can hear the cook at work and smell everything then you'll love this place,they cater as well and you can get your food to go. Check them out you won't regret it!!
When I first approached the truck the guy was short and looked like he was drunk and high..after about an hour of waiting for our food..it came in and the fries tasted like fish, like it was fried in the same 0ld fryer..and so cold!! I walked out to see where my friends food was..since they had ordered before us and the guy cussed at me and told me that he would issue a refund then asked how I paid and then proceeded to tell me that I was a liar and slammed the window in my face and said that he would have my fucking food out shortly..so I kept calling for him and he was ignoring me..once I proceeded to walk back outside I demanded a refund he gave me my cash back and slammed the window in my face and said your 4.50 will not make my night!! This was thee worst customer service I've ever had at a food truck..this man is a disgrace to the hard working people!! I would never recommend anyone to this low life!!
I recently had an experience with chow time tonight , to say the least it was absolutely a trainwreck . I ordered 2 items and waited over an hour to not even receive our food . In between waiting for our food , atleast 3 separate orders that were ordered after mine were delivered , without a trace of my order in sight. He forgot our order .  I went outside of tenaya creek to check on my order and the man handed me two old chili cheese french fries loaded with jalapenos. ~That was not my order.   I proceeded to tell him that was not my order. I got a brief slam of the food truck window and the man said  " ill bring your food to you when it's f***ing ready ".  
Let me start off by saying that my review is based on the experience I received with a group of my friends..we all had the WORST experience at this food truck a few nights back. The man was so rude and unprofessional. Waited over an hour for our food, the food was cold, the frys tasted like fish (cooking oil had clearly not beem changed), and he "forgot" to bring out the other half of our group's order, he said it was ready and would bring it right in..25 minutes later, we go outside to see what's going on, and he yelled and cussed is out, slammed the window closed in our face (mid sentence). I did not wait this long, pay so much (including a tip that I wished I didn't give), to be treated the way we did. To sum it up, he only refunded half our money (stating that "our f*cking money won't make his night), we never got the rest of our food, and ended up throwing away the food we did get. I don't know how much more unprofessional you can get. Terrible experience..buyers beware.
Just ate from this food truck at the Tenaya Creek  Brewery.....Amazing! I loved the smokey hickory  taste I got from my burger. We also had the garlic parm fries and shared btw 4 people....so garlicky!I went to culinary  school so I'm picky but I approve of this place. I can totally tell that the cook is a hard working veteran and cares about what he does.
I got a few tri tip sandwiches to take to work for me and my girlfriend. They were ok. Service was good. Man was nice. I didnt have anywhere near the same experience as the previous reviwers who all posted the same review, my service was fine with only a six or seven minute wait
Great food from genuine great people. Each day the menu has something fresh and different. Love it when the smoked meats come out! Professional and clean, the slander I see here is rubbish. God would send his/her mother to Chow Time to pick up a sandwich. Believe.
I've been a fan of The Fresh Market for a while now but it's always been a little far from me. Now they've opened this location right next to my house and I'm so excited about it! 
Are you really, really rich?
Ok I'm  just going to start off by saying The Fresh Market is the only place that I have found in Charlotte that makes fresh eclairs almost as good as my old bakery in VA. named Brenner's which has been closed for some years now. The pastry shell filled with great tasting custard and top with rich tasty chocolate is definitely the 2nd best eclair I have ever had. The is meat is so fresh and they will custom make sausage and custom cut meat for you. Wide variety of sausage that they make there. I got some nice size crab legs from here. It's a nice local fresh or organic store that's very clean. The staff are friendly, knowlegeable, nice, and eager to help you. You gotta come in a get the whole experience yourself, it is too many nice things about this place to try to put all in this review. So glad that they replace the Food Lion that was here previously...
I'm a couponer, not a member of the bourgeoisie. This place is like a palace of a grocery store, with prices to match. I was able to find a couple of things that were comparable to what I am used to spending, but only a few. If you are looking for high end delicacies, they've got them. If you are looking for affordable groceries to fill your pantry with, check elsewhere. Beautiful store, just a little bit out of my price range.
I am a Fresh Market fan and have been shopping them for years elsewhere. This store has a new open design which makes it easier to navigate. I have been to this new location (near me), about 6 times and EVERY TIME they are out of stock on at LEAST one item that I came in for! I spoke to the manager who gave me a song and dance about how many people he interviewed to select his staff, and that there was a learning curve for his staff. I wonder if anyone from headquarters has visited this store to witness the low stock levels. Even the cheese bin is not piled high like other locations. The pièce de résistance was them being out of fresh breads at 10 AM two days before New Years! 
The three stars are based on price not shopping experience or variety of goods for sale. Fresh Market is similar to Whole Foods but smaller and less organic. They've got deli, meat counter, fresh produce, bakery, floral. Everything is neatly stocked and fresh looking. They have all the specialty pantry items you could want. Imagine the selection at Williams Sonoma but greater. The candy aisle is impressive just as the coffee selection. I like coming here for meats and specialty goods but I can't imagine getting all my groceries here or I'd be broke!
I love the fresh market and love how there's one on this side of town! Yes it's a little pricey and yes you have to be careful not to spend too much if that's a concern, but you can find some very fresh and interesting things here! Also I've found their flowers to be very fresh and lasting! I used to get flowers from Trader Joes a lot, but found that several times they barely lasted. I'm much happier occasionally purchasing flowers here for the random pick me up. I do agree with other reviewers that you can find better deals at Traders or HT on a lot of stuff, but that doesn't mean this isn't a great little store.
For our housewarming party, we decided to get deli trays from our local Fresh Market.  Their Web site showed us a good variety of trays, with pictures, descriptions, options, estimated number of people served and pricing.  We selected the Italian meat and cheese tray, crudité, pinwheels and a desert tray.  It would have been a little better if the Web site prompted us for the meat/cheese combos we wanted for the pinwheels and the dressing for the crudité.  We put that info in the comments field on the checkout screen and they got it right.  (In my experience, most businesses never read those comments.)
The Fresh Market opened up very close to where I live and I was excited to have a new option to grocery shop that isn't Harris Teeter! When they first opened the place would get pretty busy. Now it seems like the hype has settled down and it doesn't get quite as busy. The Fresh Market is good for some things and not great for others. 
while the store is pretty and large, but customer service leaves much to be desired! The deli department is also filthy. I saw two workers kill a fly in a container with meat and then do nothing but walk away. I also ordered a sandwich and it was completely wrong. When I called back there was no apology whatsoever. Do your self a favor and go to Trader Joe's.
I enjoy this store mainly for the produce and bakery departments. Very fresh and a good variety but you pay for it. The meat and deli departments look good too but the prices are higher than I'm willing to pay. I always feel out of place there in my Harley Davidson t-shirt and jeans and the classical music playing in the background...lol. It's a little fancy.
I enjoy coming to TFM for specialties. The seafood bar and olive bar are great. The smoked salmon salad is so delish! They have tons of hidden treasures....hard to find teas and health tonics and beverages. Lots of healthy options! Also for salad lovers--watercress! That's hard to find anywhere but they keep it in stock. A great bakery, fresh produce, lots of options for healthy snacks too and the cheese section has some of the best. I definitely wouldn't shop for the week but it's. Great place to treat yourself. You deserve it !
The store is nice, clean, and organized well. It is a relaxing environment to do your shopping. The people are friendly and helpful.  The are not out of stock of anything frequently.  Nice place.  Need more cashiers at lunch though!
Most of their meat is of good quality, fresh and organic, but other than the meat there was a very limited selection of organic items available.
I have been a fan of the Fresh Market since I was a child. I would always get a bag of licorice and an IBC root beer. That hasn't changed but I have added some more items to my regularly bought list like the deviled egg potato salad from the deli. It is highly addictive! Or the lemon poppy muffins...so moist, and big, and delicious! They always have a great selection of meat in the butcher shop and the freshest produce.
Excellente cuisine Mexicaine authentique tout était délicieux le service était super aussi
100% Ratatouille experience! 
There's not many good Mexican restaurants in pointe Claire let alone the west island but this place is worth a shot. The restaurant is not the fanciest of places but that's ok! The food speaks wonders for it! I had the fajitas and they were absolutely wonderful! Full of flavour. They also give you warm tortillas. They're served on a cast iron skillet and you assemble them yourself. Give this place a chance and help them prosper because they definitely deserve it. I'll be frequenting here again!!!
Wow !!!! 
What a find (thank you Yelp)!  West Island eating just got  better with the addition of this simple, fresh and authentic Mexican restaurant. Ok so the decor and location aren't much but the food is wonderful - a perfect balance of freshness and heat. As you're seated you're served with freshly made warm tortilla chips and small bowls of red and green house salsas.  The red was very good, the green was great - a little bit tangy, medium spicy and a nice "green" flavour. I wish they sold it in jars! 
Great hole in the wall! Delicious food and very friendly. Highly recommended!! I had the Huevos Rancheros from the brunch menu and it was amazing. Big serving and the prices are not bad at all.
Such a disappointment for many reasons...I was under the impression that this was a Resto.It is not.It is a 15 seat Cantina inside an Industrial Office Building.Very hard to find, and was not expecting what I saw once entered the establishment.The Owner/Chef was running around trying to satisfy 10-12 orders and drowning by doing so.There is no Liquor licence, but also no BYOB.....you can have water or Mexican Soft Drinks....
30 min still no food, had to walk out, cooks had no hair net watsoever with long curly hair, kitchen wide open from the bathroom view ? Gross.
Very good breakfast. Option toast or biscuits and gravy (good). One of the best breakfast places we have found in Apache Junction. Big crowd on Sunday morning. Everything is clean and good service. We recommend this to everyone.
Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  there were only 8 tables and we waited 45 minutes to eat.  the pancakes were raw and gritty, the potatoes were under cooked, tasted boiled with no seasoning and their home made sausage sucked.  then when we complained all the lady whose name we did not get, say that we just had a bad experience.  I have served my whole life, this place's customer service was not up to par.  there were alot more people there that also were complaining and it took up to 20 minutes for them to bring more plates to a round table with 6 people.  I will never eat here again and will spread the word.  worse ever.  Wanted not to pay but I did.  and the lady who serviced us was very rude.
The restaurant was pleasant. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. I had the corned beef hash and eggs. Excellent! You should go here!
This was our second attempt to have a meal.  First time we had lunch there; wait service incredibly slow but finally got our meal, which was mediocre at best.  Today, after calling first to ensure they were open, I was told by someone that they were open until 2.  At 1:10 we pulled in just to be rudely told they closed at 1:00.  When I pointed out someone had just told me on the phone they were opened until 2 this person told me, well, they were wrong.  Wow.  Thanks for wasting my time and gas.  And by the way, this website lists the operating hours as being open until 8 PM.  No way to run a business.  And you've lost mine.  Never again.
We tried Sunday breakfast, we expected it to take awhile but finally getting our food an hour after being seated was ridiculous.  My husband's French toast was burned & soggy skinny bacon. I had a chorizo burrito & very little chorizo. Then we had to ask for our check.Will not be returning.
We were hoping for more Indiana type food. I did get the tenderloin. It was OK.  Just your typical side stop restaurant.
Great family style restaurant with good home cooking! Brought the kids for breakfast and everyone was happy. We will definitely come back again!!!
I was having a problem with my RO system I was not getting water I looked on Yelp and called the first name that was there he was booked up for 2 weeks and a half I didn't want to wait that long call me in patient but I love my RO water and don't want to do without it long story short I went back on Yelp and found Christopher James the second name on the list Thank You Yelp I do have to say and you let me start with if there was more stars than 5 Christopher would have got every star I called him and he fit me in that day actually within a couple of hours he walked me through what was wrong how it could possibly happen and walked me through everything he was going to do to fix my problem very respectful very courteous very kind young man I would recommend him to anybody he knows his job likes his job and the awesome thing about Christopher James as he works 24 /7 he will never tell you no even when he's booked that he cannot make it I have never met anyone else that has come to my home to do any kind of repairs like Christopher James again thank you Yelp for your service
I found (and called) the father, Paul, first.  Per the other reviews, he is slowly retiring ... and booked 2 weeks out.  So I called his son, Christopher.
I found Christopher on Yelp and was extremely pleased.  He returned my call quickly and was able to come over within a couple of days.  
Had an issue with my system that I needed fixed fast. After not getting callback from other businesses listed here, I called Chris. He quickly diagnosed my issue, and even though it was late in the day, Chris said he could come over in the morning. After arriving he took the time to explain each part of my system, and promptly had it fixed and working perfectly again - all at a reasonable rate! I will definitely be having Chris maintain my system going forward.
Christopher was referred to me by his father, who also does reverse osmosis. Christopher came and I paid him $100 cash. The system wasn't working when he left, but Christopher assurred me that the tank was filling up, and if I had a problem, he had a 30-day guarantee, and that I could call his father if I needed to reach him. Two days later, water was still not coming out of the faucet. I called Christopher for a week without a call back. I called his father, who said that he contacted him. " He told me about you. He said you're a nice lady. He's going to call you. If he doesn't, call me back," Paul said. I called Paul back, and he became indignant and said that he might be able to get to me a week later. "I'm not doing it because it's my responsibility. You refer people..that doesn't mean it's my responsibility." Now, I'm out of $100, without a working system, and Christopher is still dodging my calls. I wouldn't refer either one of them to anyone.
I WOULD NEVER USE THIS SERVICE EVER AGAIN. Christopher was referred to my family by his aging father, who had nothing but good things to say about Christopher's work, although Chris himself is not employed by his fathers business and instead does reverse osmosis work as a side job. Chris came out to complete the job, however after he left my system was still not working but he assured us it would soon be ass soon as the tank filled with water. The tank never started to work, so I called Christopher back to complete the work, since he promised a 30 day warranty. Two weeks after the work was done, Christopher has still not returned my over 30 calls requesting service. His father was also no help. Now, two weeks after Christopher's initial work, our reverse osmosis is still not working, and I now have a new leak that may or may not be related to Christopher's work while in my home.
I had the EXACT SAME experience as Erica R. and LaVonda R. I could copy and paste their reviews but just read them. I feel scammed
Amanda is the real deal!  And she's what Lulu's Aesthetics is all about. I've been her client for some time now, and she never disappoints. The location is easy to find, with ample street parking. Amanda uses only the best products and she listens carefully to hear what you want. She wants you to look great AND feel great after she works her magic on you. She listens to what you want and uses that information to deliver the look you're aiming for. Yay, Amanda and Lulu's Aesthetic
Amanda is a true expert and amazing at what she does.  I have been getting waxed for over eight years and Amanda by far is one of the BEST! I was fortunate enough to find her over a year ago and I will follow her wherever she goes!    
Seriously love This girl!!!! She does wonders for eyebrows! Go see her! I have had such a problem with getting my eyebrows to the right shape.  After visiting Amanda the 1st time they looked fabulous. Now they are so perfect I get so many compliments!
Amanda is the best, period. 
I have had the same person do my brows for years and was beyond nervous to try someone new..but I am beyond happy that I did! Amanda is amazing and does such a great job. Every time I leave I feel like my face is completely transformed and I feel great. She is my go to girl and I would highly recommend her for all waxing and aesthetic needs. She's not only a highly talented professional but is very accommodating and really provides optimal customer service. I was in a jam and about to go on a trip and she made it work; I couldn't be more grateful.
I did it. Committed the over tweezed eyebrow crime. I have been a client of Amanda's for about a year now - but not for brows. There was no hesitation. Once I realized the error of my ways, I immediately called Amanda! Was able to seamlessly book an appointment and am happy to report I am on my way to brow recovery! 
Amanda is the eyebrow whisperer!  My brows have never looked better.  They are fuller and people have described them at "killer".  She is super flexible with her schedule and pricing is great!  Definitely go see her!!
Amanda is fantastic!  I came to her after having years of "chop shop" waxing on my brows. She has completely transformed them, they looks so good now!  I would highly recommend her for brows, Brazil's and facials!  She's a true artist!
Amanda does fantastic work! She is amazing with brows and does quick and easy brazilians. Her facials are so relaxing and she has a great touch. She uses Luzern, which I love and are superior products. I look forward to seeing her again soon!
I have never gotten my eyebrows done before because I have such light blonde hair and I didn't want them to be too over done/ unnatural /dramatic, but I am absolutely in love with Amanda's services (brow tint and wax) and would HIGHLY recommend her!! She really listens to what you want and is a perfectionist! Very professional and extremely affordable! Love love love the results and can't wait to go back!
I've been seeing Amanda for over a year and will not go to anyone else for waxing.  Amanda is very thorough and will get every last bit of hair off.  She will go above and beyond to get me in for last minute services!
Amanda was Awesome. Super professional, explained everything she was using and what it did for my face! She also waxed my brows and did an incredible job. 5 stars! She was gentle, soothing and comfortable! Even gave me samples to take home. :)
They say your eyebrows should look like sisters, not twins.  Well, before I found Amanda, my brows looked like anorexic neighbors. The little lady at the chop shop I had been visiting was slowly making my brows thinner and more misshapen each time. Amanda helped me get them back to their proper size while still keeping them presentable during regrowth. I won't let anyone else near my brows anymore and I would drive however far for Amanda's magic touch.  I'm so excited to try her new facials and let her put her perfectionism and attention to detail to work on my skin!  Did I mention that she's incredibly sweet too?  Seriously, people, what are you waiting for?  Let her get your brows in sisterly shape today!
I'll keep this simple about the facial I got:::: 
My friend recommended Amanda to me and I couldn't be more pleased!! She did such an AMAZING job on my eyebrows. Never have they looked better I am feeling like a Million Bucks ;)  I already scheduled my next appointment with her AND  plan on getting a Facial as well. It doesn't get any better then this!
I've been going to Amanda for brow waxing for over a year now and refuse to let anyone else touch them. She's extremely detailed and has done an amazing job each time. I've recommended friends to her and would highly recommend again. She's the best of the best!
I've been seeing Amanda for around a year and cannot stress the exceptional service Amanda provides!  She goes above and beyond every time, which I appreciate as a Lulu's regular.  From a brow wax to a Brazilian, she makes these not-so-pleasant experiences incredibly bearable.  There's a reason her clients are so loyal...!!
I've never had anyone make me feel like such a VIP! Amanda is not only the most talented esthetician I've ever been to, but by far the most personable.  She is the only one I trust for my brows and Brazilian, and she is definitely the most thorough. 
First time here and I'm already a big fan! Amanda kept my brows the thickness they need to be and not so thin you can't tell u have a brow! Needless to say.. I will definitely be back.
Amanda saved my eyebrows! I had the genius idea to get my eyebrows done at the airport (bad bad idea) and they completely messed up my arch and my brows were so thin and odd looking. I read Amanda's glowing reviews and immediately set up an appointment for a week and a half after, to give my eyebrows time to grow out a little. I didn't think it would be possible to fix my eyebrows in one visit but she did the impossible. My eyebrows looked like they belonged on my face again. The majority of eyebrow waxers don't understand or listen when I ask them to not wax my brows too thin. Finally! Someone who understands thicker brows! 
I can absolutely say that Amanda is the best at what she does. I have some brows that always need taming and she has consistently waxed and shaped them beautifully!
I have been going to Amanda since she was at Canyon Ranch in Tucson. Naturally, once I moved up here, I continued to see her. She is such a fantastic woman. She's always so warm and welcoming. Our visits are honestly fun! I've seen her for an array of things- waxing and facials. She has so much knowledge to provide, even about things I never knew! She's been thoroughly educational about my beauty needs. My eye brows are now full thanks to her showing me the wonders of Rapid Lash. I'm always waxed to the finest precision. OMG and her facials?!?! INCREDIBLE!!! I recommend her to everyone and I hope everyone gets the pleasure of her incredible expertise and her amazing personality!
I was referred to Amanda by a friend and she is just fantastic!!! She does an excellent job, I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else! I drive 35 miles to come to her!!!! Not to mention she's fun to be around and mallets you feel totally comfortable!
I just recently moved back from NYC and was faithful to my threading but I read so many amazing reviews for Amanda on here and I was more than thrilled after leaving! Her specialty is keeping your brows full and beautiful and she does it very well. I have never had someone as attentive as her work on my brows. She is definitely a perfectionist! 
Amanda is the best!  I get all my hair removed from her!  She's amazing at Brazilians!  I wouldn't go anywhere else (well, one day I did and I'll never do it again!).  She is so meticulous and detailed with the Brazilian, eyebrows, everything!
Was searching for someone to do my eyebrows after many horrible experiences, I found Amanda and she is honestly the sweetest thing. I have been seeing her for a few months now and my brows have never looked better. My whole family is now seeing her and we couldn't be happier.  I will not see anyone else and now my next appointment will be for a facial as well, she's very knowledgeable !
I am from PA and this was a last minute thing! I never ever leave reviews but this place just deserves one! Amanda is just great! the place is gorgeous! affordable! online booking ON POINT! my eyebrows and I will be forever grateful!
I've been extremely pleased with the services provided every time I've visited. From the moment you walk in to the moment you step out the door, customer satisfaction is the highest priority.  Always being greeted with a smile and dealing with a consummate professional keeps me coming back. 
Amanda was really great. She took her time to make sure my eyebrows came out perfect. Will definitely go to her for my eyebrows from now on.
I'll start off by saying I will never see anyone else but Amanda to do my eyebrows!   I was never one to get my eyebrows waxed because I have sensitive skin, so I swore it off.  With a wedding/honeymoon coming up soon in May 2015, I decided to search for options to get my eyebrows taken care of; tweezing was not making me feel absolutely confident.  I knew that there had to be someone out there that could help me make them look clean and well-groomed!
I have been going to Amanda for a few years for my brows. She is the only aesthetician who understands my obsession for full, symmetrical brows. She is a true perfectionist in the best possible way.  Did I mention that she is delightful as well? Always courteous and responsive, not to mention funny and sweet. Getting a wax or facial with her is like hanging out with an old friend! You won't be disappointed if you give her a try.
Amanda made me beautiful for my birthday. Tinted and waxed my brows. I'm grateful I found someone who knows how to do brows properly!
Amanda is AMAZING!
AMANDA IS AWESOME made my eyebrow alive again yuppp alive... Highly recommend...I have semi eyebrow tattoo and it was fading away and she fix it for me...I'm so happy I found her.... will come back....
My brows were a mess thanks to a quick job done at a pedicure place. Amanda skillfully fixed them for me and even showed me how to use a brow pencil to fill in! She really took her time and did a wonderful job. Additionally, her prices are very reasonable! From now on, I will only go here!
Amanda was absolutely amazing! This was my first time getting my eyebrows waxed, so I was very careful to read as many reviews as possible to choose the right person for the job. Lulu's Aesthetics had great reviews and showcased pictures of their work (fantastic, natural-looking brows!), so it wasnt long before I was in their comfy spa chair/bed. The whole experience was very relaxing and virtually painless! I was expecting it to be extremely painful, as I've heard waxing usually is. But the wax and the unique way Amanda waxes and tweezes the brow hairs was painless and actually quite calming. Amanda herself is very sweet and made the first-time-wax experience less nerve-racking. My brows turned out fantastic! Natural-looking, thicker and more cleanly structured than my brows have ever looked before. My brows actually looked like they belonged on my face!
Amanda's work is magical! She can work wonders on my brows and have them looking better than I could even imagine! Will no longer trust anyone else with my brows!
15 years ago, thin was in. Little did I know I was destroying my brows. Not only has Amanda motivated me and encouraged me to grow my brows out, she's found their original shape and has maintained it! I refuse to allow anyone else tell me about skin care or overall beauty care. Amanda uses Luzern which is so exclusive, only a few resorts are authorized to use/sell it- and she was granted special authorization to use and retail it... I did my research. Jennifer Aniston, Emma Watson, the Houstons... Many high profile people use Luzern. It's crazy that I'm able to get this product steps away from my front door! Not only are her products sensitive to my breakout prone skin, she's so gentle and her technique is efficient and the best I've ever experienced. Parking is easy, and the salon itself is a gem! I'm so thankful, grateful, and gracious I found this amazing woman that can make me feel just as amazing!
I recently moved to the area for college and needed someone trust worthy to wax my eyebrows. I was so happy when I decided to give Amanda a try. she not only makes my eyebrows look great but she brightens my day! I look forward to my next appointment, where as they are always so relaxing and make me feel so pampered. highly highly recommend!
Honestly very happy my sister found this place for me after I missed my appt at my normal place.  Amanda was amazing and knew exactly what I wanted to do to my eyebrows without saying a word and after this visit I can say I have a new place to get my eyebrows done. Definitely recommend coming here...great prices and wonderful owner!!!
Jesus beyond blessed Amanda's hands!!! She is AMAZING!!!!! I have been to every kind of shop there is, Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Latino (wax & thread)  and no one has ever paid attention as to what I always asked for (full brows) and without question Amanda hit the nail on the head! I absolutely love my new brow shape and brow tint!! After letting them grow for 3months she beyond exceeded my expectations making the wait and growth worth while! The most painless experience I've ever had with any kind of wax. She is super sweet and personable! Her shop is super easy to find, very clean and mellow environment. I can't wait to go back for other services & would most definitely recommend to any and everyone! She's the best!
So far I've had one appointment for my eyebrows and will be going back. I am trying to grow them. She shaped them perfect for what she is working with and understands what I'm trying to do to shape them best for my face. I've struggled with other places where they do well for a while then out of no where take off waaaay more than they should and BAM I'm back to the 90s with pencil thin, nearly nonexistent brows. And by then it's too late- not like you can glue the hair back on.... I've also started using rapidlash to help in the process. I'll post before/after pics in a few months once I see more progress.
Amanda at Lulu's completely changed my face and confidence for the better. I had the pleasure of being referred to Amanda about a year and a half ago, after a lady at one of those brow threading places in the mall threaded off more than half my natural brow. I didn't know if they would ever come back. Amanda was just as horrified as I was when she saw my brows, but assured me that she would get them back for me. With Amanda's amazing technique and amazing products, my brows are now more full, shaped, and beautiful than they have ever been. After I experienced what Amanda could do with my brows, I started trying her facials and amazing Luzern facial products. I have never had a better facial in my life! I had her oxygen infused microdermabrasion facial and it was like having a face transplant. I'm moving to Southern California, and unfortunately, will not get to pop in and see Amanda as much as I want to, but you better believe I will every time I'm back in town. With everything she's done for me and with what a beautiful and amazing friend she has become, I just had to share my experience with her on here for everyone to see!
I just got back from visiting Amanda at Lulu's and I can finally breathe! I just moved to Phoenix and was loyal to one person prior to my move - when it came to my brows. I have spent 4 months with big bushy eyebrows hoping to find the right place. 
It was my first time going to Lulu's Aesthetics and I absolutely loved the service! Amanda is very personable and efficient. The space itself is beautiful, clean, and calming. She did a great job with eyebrow waxing and I will be back again.
Amanda did such a wonderful job on my eyebrows! I was nervous getting them done for the first time and she was so knowledgable and thorough! Treatment room was beautiful and clean! I would recommend her to anyone and everyone!!!
Dr. Mora is AMAZING and really knows her stuff! I have been receiving prolozone therapy on my wrist after a ligament injury 6 months ago. I highly recommend The Anti- Aging Spot for any sports injury! Beautiful office, great knowledgeable staff and convenient location!
I love this place because of the atmosphere and the the location. Dr Melanie Rose Icard is always so positive and very knowledgeable. My favorite therapies are vitamin IVs, acupuncture, bio modulator and Ozone spa. Great experience every time.
I love this place! The doctors really know what they are doing. I adore the ozone sauna and seeing the results from expelled toxins. Everyone is always so nice! Highly recommended.
I wanted to thank two young Naturopathic Doctors for what they do and for taking such good care of me! Dr. Melanie ICard NMD and Dr. Carmen ND are two of the finest in the business. 
Had some time to kill before a morning customer meeting and needed some caffeine. Found this place on Yelp and glad I did. It hit the spot. Quaint local coffee house with the regular offerings and it looked like a few other choices as well. I stuck with a caramel macchiato no whip, 16oz and it was  just what I needed. Not too sweet, hot and the coffee was flavorful. The caramel didn't overpower it. Give it a try some morning.
Great customer service. Excellent coffee. Relaxing atmosphere. Free WiFi. Its close to home and I enjoy coming here in the mornings. Prices are very reasonable. You can also purchase coffee to brew at home; I have not yet but will soon, since I own a keurig.
I visited this cafe this morning & was greeted by the owner first thing, which gives a very welcoming feeling.  The service was excellent & the atmosphere was very friendly.  I was impressed by the POS system to pay for my tea & croissant, which I enjoyed very much.  This is a great place to meet friends, new & old and a great place to relax.
Great coffee!  The staff is always friendly. Lovely place. House blend is always good. Speciality blends are fun to try.
This is my new  go to spot for java.  Very friendly, relaxing atmosphere, and the caramel macchiatto that I had was amazing!  I also had the pecan bar, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was crazy good!!  If you are in for a chewy, nutty, buttery treat, I'd highly recommend this one.  The service was excellent.  This is a great place to sit and chat with friends, or, like in my case,  to work.  They provide free WiFi and power hookups if needed.
I loved this place before it became Coppa, and it is still just as awesome.  Great coffee made exceptionally well. Their sweets are awesome too.
The staff here are incredibly friendly and are genuine in their attempt to make sure the customer is happy. It was one of the staff member's first time doing a pour-over and she was genuinely concerned about the quality of my drink because she wanted to make sure she got it right and she got it right. I like how you can pick your beans for the pour-over from a selection of 20 or so glass jars. Definitely something for everyone as was the selection of brewed coffees in carafes. I counted 5 on this day. 
Love this little spot! Greeted immediately upon entering with "good morning!" and smiles from the 2 young employees at the counter. I wanted something sweet and they cheerfully helped me select something from their menu. I got the Caramel Macchiato as recommended by another Yelper and it did not disappoint. Hot, sweet and hit the spot! The decor is cozy with smooth jazz playing, several tables to sit at and a comfy leather sofa up front. I stuck around to drink my coffee and lounge on that comfy sofa. :-) I just wish this place was a destination I pass more often but I might reconfigure my route to make sure I drive by!
Nice quiet place outskirts of Charlotte. Staff is always very friendly. Coffee brew is nice - nothing bitter, and prices are reasonable.
Coppa Coffee is a fabulous little coffee shop that I discovered while running errands. I had seen it before but decided to stop in.  I am a Starbucks addict. I don't like anything else that I try. Coppa has a coffee drink called White Moose and that is what I tried the day I stopped in.  I have to say that exceeded my expectations to the point where I will say (& I can't believe I'm saying this) IT IS BETTER THAN STARBUCKS! If I wasn't trying to wean myself off of coffee right now I'd be there everyday.  Besides the coffee being good, the staff is friendly and I've seen the same faces so I think they have a nice following.  The negative... I stopped in for an ice cream date with my daughter because they advertise Tony's Ice Cream. We are originally from Gastonia where the original Tony's ice cream is so we are familiar with its goodness. This is where I was dissappointed. The young lady (in training) who made the ice cream cones confirmed with the owner if she had enough on the cones which he said "that's good". There was such a small amount of ice cream on the cone. At the actual Tony's Ice Cream you get 8-10 more on the cone (that's not an exaggeration) than what I received at Coppa and I believe I paid more than what Tony's charges.  I will actually drive back to gastonia for ice cream if I get a craving before purchasing it at Coppa. So, great coffee just don't get the ice cream unless you only want 1 tiny scoop thus I give it a 4 out of 5!
Great little coffee shop across from the Mt. Island Lake shopping center. I've been here a few times - they have a few tables and a nice couch/sitting area. It's a narrow coffee shop but utilizes space well. They have a wide variety of coffees, teas, and alternatives - they also have a bunch of flavor shots (sugar free too), and flavored coffee beans you can buy to grind yourself. The ice cubes they give for the iced coffee are huge and they are made of frozen coffee beans! The coffee itself is decent - better than average. I haven't tried any of the food or baked goods, but nice that they have a little bit of a selection. The employees are very friendly as well. .50 for small refills, .75 for medium refills
The employees are extremely friendly. They greet you as you walk in the door, and speak to you as you're leaving. Coffee is excellent! Way better than the coffee shop that used to be in its place. I got a mocha that was probably the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back and check out their other offerings, as well as the teas.
For a local coffee shop I'd expect a stellar experience especially with the dreaded green mermaid across the street in the grocery store. We ordered 4 specialtiy drinks and an ok chocolate muffin. The espresso based drinks just aren't to my liking. The roast tastes like a medium roast and isn't as dark as I'd like. In my book an espresso should be made with a dark roast but thats just me. Or maybe its the bean they use that I don't particularly like? In either case I'm not a fan.  The chocolate muffin was so-so... And sadly that means I will not be back. It stinks because I love the atmosphere in this skinny little coffee shot. Oh well off to my next java joint!
So I purchased a car from them in Feb. and I already have had to make over $1100 in repairs. I am a first time buyer and I feel awful! I would not buy from them again. Buyer beware! I should have done more research I guess but I would not want anyone else to have to go threw what I am right now. I also purchased there extended warranty which is crap. You can never get ahold of them and they have yet to call me back or help with anything. Do not purchase there extended warranty!
I had a really great experience buying a car from here. Tim was great and negotiated a great deal. Once we agreed on a price, the process was quick and I left driving my "new" car. I felt that I was treated well and I would purchase from them again.
