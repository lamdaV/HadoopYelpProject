GqGx1kvA7x5YV00o-YkzqQ	I would give 5 stars but the hipster staff looks exactly like the hipster guests and I can tell which hipster to ask for services from. I may be being harsh but I personally find it one star worth of annoying. They should at least have some sort of hipster dress code where all the hipsters look like working hipsters instead of guest hipsters.  Other than the staff not having any resemblance of being employed there I think the place rocks. Good food but not cheap. The scenery makes up for the food prices. The games are fun but it's definitely missing a major bar game = billiards.  Decor is awesome and so is the rest. Good times.
fE2NBe8teLXzum6naHlcgg	Absolute blast!!! Try the pretzel bites with fondue, they're amazing. Also their burgers are great. Drinks are a little pricey, but great. Also, they have games(ping pong, corn hole, etc.) Definitely a fun hangout with friends.
mXkfwsuvwA4bjxmyVBX1Iw	One of my favorite places in phoenix. the food is always good, the service is unfortunately always slow, but the food, like I said, GOOD!
UyPF9_Ab0FK_thdv9T8CHA	Loved it! great atmosphere and the food was decent, the drinks were fabulous!
G9PNOrdh9ZbMHPFrThcpTA	Great Hipster place!!! Meaning:   1.) Good tasting and well thought out food selection 2.) Nice craft beer selection 3.) Staff is friendly, tattooed, pierced and trendily dressed 4.) Little over priced  Gotta have all four to be called a good hipster place.
2rJCj1h5NLn2z4kbvOVDYg	My wife and I met her cousin and his wife for lunch on Saturday, January 9, 2016.  This was a very neat place!  There was indoor seating, but we decided to sit "outside" in a patio area.  The area was covered overhead, but was open air.  The outside temperature was very cool and the area that we sat in was equipped with over heaters as well as fire pits.  The seating selections were tables, booths, and then some sofa type lounges surrounding the fire pits.  The restaurant had some great local brews on tap.  I ordered a Kilt Lifter from Four Peaks Brewing (Tempe, AZ) and a Dale's Pale Ale from Oskar Blues Brewery (Longmont, CO).  Both were served very chilled and went down smooth!  For lunch, I went with Butternut Squash Cannelloni.  The plate was served with mushrooms, smoked shallot, caramelized fennel, parmesan, and herb butter.  Inside the cannelloni was a butternut squash puree, and then there were chunks of very tender butternut squash served on top.  This entree was absolutely delightful!!!  There were so many flavors going on with each bite, I was in Heaven!  My wife ordered the Turkey Pastrami sandwich which she said was very good.  It must have been, because she finished the entire sandwich!  Great place, great location, great food, and great beer!  This place was a hit!
-KDCfacoQ2zUDSuWXb3_IQ	This place was so amazing! The food is to dye for!
Md3TPaUVSqykOcbKVO0z_w	Food, service and ping pong were awesome! My hub had the meatloaf; thumbs up there. I had the pork belly ramen and it was really good. Brussels are served at room temp which is odd, but was ok because our server told us ahead of time so we didn't think we were getting food that had cooled while waiting to be delivered. The 4 star rating is due to the antipasto/app/snack confusion; it's hard to tell how and what to order. Our server was helpful, but it was still confusing. Overall it was a great experience. I would go back in a heartbeat if I lived here.
lI3Mdt-826jEcimm72_r2A	My first impression of Culinary Dropout is how much style and creativity went into the restaurant itself.  Albeit a little hard to find at first (it's tucked away near the train tracks west of Mill Ave), this place has one of the most beautiful, laid-back interiors I've seen in awhile.  In what looks to be a warehouse that was seriously remodeled, they have enough space to fit a stage for live bands, a full alcohol bar, and a plethora of seats and tables.  Speaking of live bands, they have live bands playing on the weekends, even during lunch hours!  The music was at a perfect volume: loud enough to enjoy, but quiet enough to be able to hold a conversation at your table.  Very, very nice touch of entertainment to an already good-vibes kinda place.  My friend and I both ordered the Fried Chicken, which they are supposed to be well-known for.  Even as a Texan of 1.5 years now, I have to say, this fried chicken did NOT disappoint!  You get about three pieces of fried chicken (a drumstick, a breast, and a leg), cole slaw, a buttery biscuit, and some mashed potatoes & gravy.  All 4 were seriously on point and complemented each other perfectly.  The cole slaw in particular was quite the heavenly surprise.  Some of the white meat in my chicken leg was a little bit dry, but it was otherwise extremely and superbly well done.  Unfortunately, I did not try any of the beverages or appetizers on the menu, but it's just one of many more reasons to come back.  Four and a half stars in my book, and will probably see star #5 after my next visit.  If you're anywhere in the Phoenix Area, this place is a must visit.
kfleZpAYQVei95c9LMeqGg	My wife and I came here with friends last weekend. Culinary dropout creates a great first impression. It was very clean and modern and looked like it was in a warehouse sort-of building. My wife called it an "industrial" look. We sat at a table in the back by the bar, on their patio area and it was pretty noisy but it created a fun atmosphere. We ordered soft pretzels that came with cheese sauce and those were gone within minutes. We almost ordered more! We also got the thai chicken wings which were so-so. I wasn't a big fan of those. I didn't have anything to drink, but my wife ordered "Between you & me" which had vodka, grapefruit and cranberry. I tried a sip and it was very flavorful. For dinner she had a shrimp ceaser salad which she loved and I tried the Pub burger. It was excellent! We played some lawn games and had such a fun night. Great service, great atmosphere. Wife and I will definitely be back for date night.
blM04SmQ9ewUjUCOK_pxeg	Good food..a little pricey for what they serve. Had a burger here and it was pretty good. Love the live Music they had great place to go drink some beers and chill..
Q61JPwuaLJsVmH1VwoDekA	I'd heard good things about Culinary Dropout over the years, so I was excited to finally try it on my recent trip to Tempe. The Tempe location is quite large and we almost went in a wrong entrance (it looked like perhaps this was the entrance for private events?).   We had a reservation and were seated immediately, even though the restaurant was hopping on a Friday night.   I had one of the "copperless" moscow mules. It's disappointing not to have the mug, but the drink was mixed to perfection and garnished with a piece of candied ginger (yum!).  We started with the roasted brussel sprouts. They were delicious, but they are served cold (which was fine, but they should call that out because we were confused!). We also had the truffled potato chips, which were great. Both of these are fairly small portions, but enough for some light bites before the entree.  We then split the fried chicken and the turkey pastrami. Our server even arranged to have the dishes split for us (wow!) so we didn't have to manage that.   The fried chicken was alright, but I didn't bother to finish my half. The sides were great though. Honestly, I found the turkey pastrami on the pretzel roll to be the better entree.  We finished with the salted caramel custard, which was topped with caramel corn. Loved that!  Our server was awesome--friendly, gave his honest opinion on the dishes and helped us pick some great items. I'd definitely visit again!
sgU30GFtrKVowZQbr-Z23w	Great atmosphere for drinks hanging out and good overall selection of food. Pretzels and cheese are clutch. Great Draft beer selection along with bottles. If your in the area definitely worth a drop in. Great service and friendly staff. FYI Friday's and Saturday nights are busy so make sure to plan Accordingly. Cheers
BI2fE39cV-FWs-1xlP7qmA	Lunch for 3.  - Ambiance (5/5) Awesome exposed warehouse atmosphere.  Open, laid back, and sophisticated.  - Service (4/5) Quick and courteous.  Overly friendly, if that's possible?  Sometimes, I just want to eat my food and not listen to you gush about the restaurant.  But, seriously, if I were the boss, I'd be excited to see an employee so excited about the place.  - Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue, $10 (3/5) Pretty good pretzels, though the fondue really just tasted like melted provolone.  Some more layers of flavor would have been good.    - 36 Hour Pork Ribs, $23 (4/5) Definitely falling off the bone delicious, though I did find the sauce to be a little bit on the salty side.  - Value (5/5) Ridiculous portions for the price.  - Final Word Awesome place to hang out and enjoy some really good food.
56RGTtxCdM0QGq86JQGdjA	Great as pub, but not so much as restaurant, especially at Friday night. One hour for us to find a high table(first come first serve), then half an hour later I received SMS from host tell me a normal table is ready...  Very energetic place in a big warehouse, loud music, young college kids, can't complain about that. But I am not too impress with the food. Soft Pretzels with Fondue tastes reasonable good, though a little too plain. Fried chicken is pretty good, juicy and tasty, though still not something that can be rated as outstanding. I understand it's a place more for atmosphere, so definitely not a bad choice in Tempe, but the food is not worth the waiting time anyway.  It would be better if you want to have a party and play here of course.
fyDzZNRyQxpah5gTYC5Gdg	I love the friend chicken and the fun cocktails, but mostly I enjoy the vibe. They've done a great job creating a swank atmosphere, and I like knowing that I can always go and grab a drink at the back bar while I wait for my table. A fantastic place to bring friends for an entire evening of drinks, booze, and maybe some games. I think the food is mostly solid, but you're not coming necessarily for a "culinary" experience. You're coming for the vibe. And it's a good one.
g5z4Bygp0kGzfzSDmmHC7g	This place was super über cool.    Great views into the fantastic production kitchen, fun lighting throughout and great graphic atmosphere.  I loved all the tactile elements, but the food and drinks also delivered at high marks.    Great drink selection for all, and a nice menu of unique takes on standard food retail staples.  Get a reservation if you can, but have a drink and enjoy the atmosphere if you have to wait.  The place is huge but very popular right now.    Highly recommended.
NVN0vXZ4qmi6YvUjGe-WNA	Appetizers were "lost" with a mere sorry as an excuse and failed to appear at all. French fries soggy and cold, less than mediocre at best. Moscow mule is good. They have nice ping pong tables. I got the prime rib sandwich, pretty good. Asking for a napkin that was not provided at the start was a real effort for our server to fetch. Overall very unimpressed with the restaurant and the attention we received and would not recommend for sit down food service. If you are set on coming here, don't expect to get what you order, be prepared to wait a long time to be seated, and don't plan on wanting to come back.
w8CJUruWyTNEyw40XUIERA	I have been here three times (last time was Jan 10th) and every time gets better!  I have had half of the menu already.  Top three must haves #1 Pretzel bites with cheese sauce, #2 Pork Belly anything, #3 Ramen bowl.   Go on Sundays for the half off specials!    The ambiance and trendy lighting make it very hipster and I love the family atmosphere on Sundays with the outdoor games.   I'd probably have a wedding reception here.  It's really nice.
AY9nr4Hki7nNCpNntmLpEQ	cool warehouse atmosphere, decent beer selection.   Nice informal place to hang out w/ the bar and game area  Like everyone is saying, the pretzel rolls w/ the fondue is a solid app to order.    I tried the trout w/ asparagus and almonds for main course and loved it.    Will be back to try some more
KBTPs4cl2njBYMF9t1i5JA	Brought the fam for an early dinner and we had a good time.  I had: fried chicken entree  Hubby: Korean beef entree 4 yr old: buttered noodles w/fries  Well we all finished our plates! We enjoyed our food so we will be back for sure. This time though I might have to bring my own hot sauce since their only options are tobacco cholula and sriracha, & you just Can't have fried chicken and Not have Louisiana hot sauce!! So that was disappointing but the chicken was still delicious. The batter is slightly sweet & im not a big fan of sweet entrees but this was subtle and the chicken was tender & juicy so I have to say that I liked it more than LoLo's. Which I'm sure is a big statement for some people. Lol my biscuit Was (I capitalize because I ate that $hit up!) fluffy, buttery, & sweet.  4 year old daughter ate everything up which is rare so we are happy that money wasn't wasted! Shell type of noodles, a pretty good serving size & Parmesan was easy to eat.  Hubby says his plate was amazingly tasty. Period. He was satisfied so overall we had a great experience.  Service was good. He (Conner) had quite a few tables so I just had to make sure not to forget anything when he did come around.
2Ey7F0OXGqPnktnG4CigfQ	Well, here's a first. I'm still at the restaurant and leaving a review. THAT'S how much I like this place. First, the decor and atmosphere are just cool. You instantly feel more hip and fun once you cross the threshold. It feels expensive but casual. Put together but not trying to hard.  For lunch, I had the grilled cheese sliders and fries. Once the server told me that everything was homemade, I knew a side of Ranch had to happen. Trust me...when things are homemade, you always get the Ranch. My meal was delicious. The bread was buttery but had a crunch that resulted  in crumbs all over me. The cheese was melty and delicious, and the tomato...well, it made me feel better about myself, I suppose. The fries were great and the Ranch...man, I could talk about it all day.  My server, Janelle, was super busy but attentive and offered lots of suggestions. The only bad thing about this place is that I'm not here with my friends to enjoy it! Great place. Excited to come back next time I'm in town.
iv1S7x0Yiq1OuvuwIcfw3g	Great food, great service.  Love the bacon parmsean Grissini and the Bourbon black bottom pie!!!!
6RZ4GXY0orsLGxQGmU94tQ	Great setting.  Not the usual "penny pitcher" Mill Avenue crowd.  This is where I take people when they are visiting from out of town.
KaV484ZtA4z_qkn0UDXcWg	Never ever, ever again.  Three strikes and you are out!! Great food and atmosphere, but the service is beyond terrible.  They comped us... Again....  That isn't the point though, their customer service is consistently terrible, and the managers recognize it and don't deny it.  It was very nice of them, but this place is a disaster!! Food is awesome and we will continue to go to the culinary dropout in Scottsdale, but we are finished with Tempe! Understaffed and they straight up do not care!!
H1GUdVdFQCZ1ZxIUwg66Vw	Very good food, great casual atmosphere, and excellent staff service. Great place to come and watch a game with some friends.
wFysW8SGrj3YPvEZyer-Fw	Great place to spend hours!  Great food and friends as well.
CIJpVkFNUO5FuXWC1kLA3A	First experience.  Happy Hour food was pretty good, although the chopped salad was not what we were told it was going to be.  Smoked salmon bruschetta very tasty.  Drinks just fair. Would question the 12 oz claim on HH beer.
FKCT9nA-gZwLw4qrVPVA9A	Really cool place. It has a modern industrial 'warehouse' feel, but it's still very comfortable.   I had the ribs, and it was more food than I could eat. Very well cooked, and the sauce was perfect. Fries were perfectly salted.
Sd75ws6O1osytT3UTZEjtA	Excellent restaurant, bar, chill spot. The food and drinks were very good (prime rib with fontina and au jus with a seasonal saison draft). Our group of 9 was quickly seated and served. After dinner, we hit up the ping pong tables and cornhole. Most other places would charge for this, but culinary drop out does it right and provides this complimentary.
9sxCWC72bLs51MJ_5SVeqg	The place and venue is phenomenal. Right in the heart of Tempe and Arizona State University. The energy in this place is something else.   I was where before for lunch, and now came to grab dinner and drinks after work. The place was packed and very, very lively, virtually no place where to sit.   The 3-stars rating is due to the low customer service. There's just too many people to receive any kind of minimal, acceptable level of customer service.   The servers staff would benefit if they could spend more time with the people there supposed to be taking care of.   If you sit at the bar, pick the inside section. The outer section had the AC blowing right on my face. I had the pork belly ramen and some great IPAs from Deschutes
ZpEnC0QjeA3Wzn5SwBihww	Loved the atmosphere. Ate here on Christmas Eve and the food/service was great. I had the Ribs and they were amazing. Sauce was perfect and fries were perfect. We played ping pong and drank beer after our meal. Very happy with our choice!
o9FuzHAwLhsN9FG-QSL1fA	I went here after looking through Yelp reviews for local eats.   I got there at 740 with a reservation at 8 (for a tip make a reservation because it was busy). I always feel awkward making a reservation for 1 (makes me feel lonely) but whatever.   The bar area and restaurant had a really laid back but busy vibe. They had a live band which was actually really good.   I had the Lumberjack Heff....delicious. My solo mission was to get the ribeye cap, but they were sold out (sad emoji). I didn't have a backup plan but I settled starting with the wings. They were nice and crispy but for me a little too salty. For my dinner went for the meatloaf....I thought it was a little underwhelming. It was filling but I wouldn't say great.  The overall area and solid beer choices I'll be back to give it another shot...but only for a ribeye cap. Ribeye cap or bust!
qdmcJzxnxgk8hXE2kiWpmw	The Tempe location is pretty large & the yard is awesome! We always have great servers- always so nice!   I've had the turkey pastrami & liked it a lot! I wasn't a fan of the cole slaw, as it's got a little kick to it!   I've also had the meatloaf- which is DELICIOUS!!! I liked the chicken club, but it wasn't my favorite.   The pretzel balls for an appetizer is great, but the nachos are TO DIE FOR!!!
t2n5mwdaBkWxktHn8v5EDw	The food was very good! It may be a little higher priced, but you get what you pay for. Seating was comfortable and service was spot on. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the extremely loud music that made conversation almost impossible. Try the fried chicken!
SMqn9K8UxT0qLhvKYxqBPg	I have to update my review. Literally, 3 minutes after posting my original review I received a visit at our table by the manager! He apologized for the loud music and agreed that it was too loud and instructed the folks behind the bar to reduce the volume... talk about customer service! We promptly ordered another bottle of wine and enjoyed some wonderful conversation. Thank you!!
OZV0eoMbZWR4QTVyvZMYhQ	I love the food & the atmosphere at Culinary dropout, BUT making a reservation for a group is nothing short of ridiculous.  this is not the 1st time this has come up, so I'm compelled to finally comment.  I have 9 friends in town and want to take them here BUT they don't take reservations past 6 PM.  really??????  so we're left hoping (if I decide to take them, which I won't now) we can get a hightop (again, for NINE people) or couch area, and have to wait for a table at that point.  funny, the Thirsty Lion & several others take reservation times all evening long, and always gets me in (I give them 5 starts for service, food & atmosphere).  you've lost a nice chunk of money this evening, and several others at this point, but guess that probably doesn't matter.  your bad (and no, not 'you're bad').
MNfrBUkM07JfXcvaKlGeXA	This is the only place in town that should be permitted to sell Pretzel Fondue. Their bartenders are great. My favorite drinks are the After School Special and their Old Fashion.  For food, I love the Turkey Pastrami Sandwich, the Muscles, Fried Chicken or the Gorgonzola Chx Salad.
X9iQMw_AWHhLDBCIzXY6HQ	The location is so cute- they have a fantastic venue that was set up for a wedding and the food is excellent, especially the pretzels. The brunch menu is limited but everything on there looked good.
1GKSzDApq15xYHDVIDBQEg	This place is amazing! Very good food and drinks! It's a cool place to hangout with friends or have a nice dinner. I recommend the pretzels and fondue:)
cwDmtp1lqqPsmBkKIUN2pw	Only been here once as I was visiting from out of town, but what a great visit! The food was delicious and nothing short of filling -- I personally loved the pretzel rolls and monkey bread! The ambience is casual and the place is very modern looking and comfortable! We dined towards the back near the bar area, and it was great! My cousin held her wedding rehearsal dinner here and I would definitely return if I had a group with me. No complaints, the servers seemed very friendly as well!
s9MdwbUIV8tepi95FPIlGQ	Can't give a good review... I showed up at 5:45 for a friends retirement dinner and didn't have my ID so I figured I'd just sit and have some food but the location that the party was "the coop" apparently doesn't even allow people in without ID so I had to leave the party and leave my girlfriend there to be with her family. I will never come back. Terrible customer service.
VK11Q6WQXiZB1xywidsreg	Update, almost immediately after posting my review, I was contacted by the staff and given an opportunity to share my exact experience. I'm impressed and appreciative of this level of customer service. While I'm currently not planning to revisit this establishment any time soon, I'm increasing my first review.    The staff was rude, their policies are asinine. I refuse to ever patronize this group of restaurants again. Thanks for a terrible experience last night.
rt-De1c5G31OEiWwIaKlxg	A resounding "meh". Great place for a group to drink and play games but I was totally underwhelmed by the food. Pretzels did not have the right texture and were more like bread rolls than anything else, butternut squash pasta was undercooked and had practically no flavors other than the sweetness of the squash. I'd come back to give other menu items a shot but my first go around was really unimpressive.
18JRQbfZPED0gmwZHyh2jg	Good afternoon all I just want to give a shout out to Alex. He was a great server had great customer service skills. They came in from Las Vegas Nevada for the weekend .this was my first time going to this  restaurant.  I was impress with the food , environment and like I mention the great customer service from Alex .
KK5zjptHooUjb1ZKVRCTFg	The atmosphere and food is great at this location. Ashley (short brown/blonde hair) made the experience even better by being an amazing server. She was extremely attentive to our tables needs and was quick to get us anything we asked for. I would return here just to have her as a server again because her service was excellent.
NPMDQmGIBqj8czHq3S9cHA	I have been looking forward to trying this restaurant for a long time. We went with a group and I ordered the Bistro Steak, Medium with asparagus instead of Brussel Sprouts.  The steak came out and I thought it was chicken because it was so done. I tasted it, but the waiter never came back, there were also brussel sprouts on the plate. At the end of the meal, I passed the steak off to my friend and he told the waiter why I did not eat it. The manager refused to take it off the tab and never even visited our table.The waiter told me it was because he checked on me and I said it was fine. I and everyone around me disagreed with him  and told him that I did not touch my food and waited for him to come back. He acted surprised and thought he had. I told him it was fine, but I would not be back and I was disappointed because I had heard so many positive reviews.  I did not tip him well since my understanding was the reason the manager would not remove the food from my bill was because he had said I told him it was fine. I told him I would be posting this on yelp. If you go to Tempe, pick a place who values their customers.
KDvj8GU2pzmJhdKG77-j0A	Fantastic vibe, food and fun.  Had a large group and everyone loved the drinks and menu items.  We shared lots of apps, had great meals, and enjoyed the games.  Being the one person from AZ in the group, I had to pick the spot for my coworkers, and I am glad i selected Culinary Dropout.  Will return!
6MT4-E0lLe5t1OZyFOLHQw	Foods good , drink are overrated and over priced , go to eat , not to enjoy cocktails.
SpyukGO4Azv6zRRUYE8yKg	Close to giving this place 5 stars if not for the rude valet staff.  +decor/ambiance - beautiful large indoor and outdoor space.  Tons of bistro lighting and entirely hipster.   +service (except for valet) - very friendly and kept checking up on us. +food.  Everything we tried was delicious  Gorgonzola chicken salad - nice balanced salad with a lot of flavor and creaminess from Gorgonzola  Butternut squash cannoli - perfection!  I love pasta with butternut squash and this did not disappoint.  Monkey bread - if you like desserts with a texture contrast and temperature contrast, this was delicious.  Parts of the dessert were crispy from the oven and paired well with the ice cream. +cocktails and drinks - all the cocktails had an interesting twist and were interesting.  I ordered the Room Service and was super happy!  The alcohol is well masked by the strawberry and I could have drank a few of them easily.  -valet staff - so we came around 8p on a Monday and maybe valet service already ended for the night but there are signs everywhere that state valet parking only.  We pulled up to valet and the guys there were all busy talking and ignored us for a few minutes.  Finally one of them said park it yourself.  Thanks guys.
KF1IxItn1Nc9W6HWxPvLCw	I've come here a half dozen times with different groups at a variety of times and it has always been a hit!  We come for work lunches and they are welcoming to large groups on separate checks.  We came with my family for new years and they had the full regular menu as well as a specials menu.  I also came for a late dinner and drinks with friends and it was a great hang out bar atmosphere.  Finally, we went with my mother in law who has extremely severe food allergies and they were informative of the ingredients in each item and very accommodating.  The wait staff is always polite, helpful and attentive.  The food and drinks are always delicious!  I highly recommend them!
VimlViHZVJhsogS-zWqUug	"School Cafeteria Dropout" is more like it.  Really pretty disappointed after all I heard so much about this place.    I had the Butternut Squash Cannelloni which seems like it was house made, +1 on that, but was excessively salty.  It was Edible, but missing something in the flavor department.  Tried a sampling of other's food and it was similarly lackluster.  Top that off with being over crowded and uncomfortable as can be: Too nosiey, choice of couch bent over low table to eat or metal high stool/chairs that made my skinny butt uncomfortable.  Our server was friendly and I felt for the guy... being that 3 times food was returned to the kitchen having come out completely wrong.
dEWrvU2rhgsPZ2fPw9auNQ	Went on a Monday afternoon, right when happy hour had started. Really nice atmosphere, bags ping pong tables. Carrara marble tables plush couches. Mural art of "legends" really a decor that everyone will like some aspect of it. Ordered a blind double. Because I'm classy. It's a random beer and random shot. My kind of place. Also ordered nachos and antipasti chefs choice. Both were very good!! I could see how this place would be awesome for a Friday or Saturday nights. Or Sunday funday. I'll for sure be back!
8leh6g5V4VHKOln4sCMA-A	Came here once before and the service was *ok but the food was pretty good. Came here tonight to bring my sister from out of town and after this experience, I'm never going back. Came in and was told I would be waiting an hour to an hour and fifteen minutes. Considering it was Friday night and they were kind of busy, I understood and decided to get some drinks. After an hour and a half I decided to go ask the hostesses what was going on and they told me "there's only a couple more tables ahead of you". After another half hour of waiting I went up and asked again and they gave me the same answer. What bothered me is that they didn't even seem to care or sympathize that I had been waiting for nearly 2 hours or try to reassure me that I would be called soon (even though we had already watched several tables get seated before us). I'm very disappointed in the service we had experienced and will not be returning, at least to this location.
XlbaP7ffpDpFpWb2Dl7uoQ	Food & drinks are amazing here!! I got great service too! Try the pretzel bites and the pastrami sandwich!!!
sYbigD-q3FavCmMNG0pmzA	Melissa had Fried Chicken, mashed potatoes, and a biscuit. I had deviled eggs, monkey bread, and Thai chili chicken wings. Deviled eggs were a little salty for my taste. Everything else was great, and very fresh. Lots of things on the menu that I'd like to try.  If you like people watching, this is the best place. The place is busy, and a lot larger than expected. People of all ages, but mainly ASU students. Lots of pretty girls wearing revealing clothes, so thumbs up for that too. Very entertaining place to eat. They also have corn hole and ping pong...
kjevYGPdSikVBqd7h5iEZQ	Opps! How have we not found this place sooner! We will definitely be back!  The food was amazing! Simple Brussel sprouts and asparagus with some deviled eggs were anything but simple!!! Yummy!  The pretzel fondue was great and the jerky was perfecto!!! :)  Cool atmosphere and great service too!
A3pTFPeyXv4J65UiU0xHYg	This is a fun place to hangout, but $10 for a drink called, "Room Service", that comes in what looks like a Barbie sized champagne glass...seriously, come on guys. Rip off.
XGoGSJ4dSxQolzHxTkM8eQ	Great place for drinks. Classic decor with a modern touch makes for a welcoming atmosphere. Spicy cocktails are
2elp4FHeAjc8dnlVwVQZCg	Thanks Brian (the manager) for taking care of us after our experience. Speaks volumes.    The decor is really dope. However this is the worst customer service. We have been sitting here for 15 minutes and no one has taken our order, after we waited 45 minutes to be seated. WOW THAT WAS THE RUDEST WAITRESS EVERRRRRR
TalGOjY3Gaa9R-JApbhiDA	My favorite place. Outstanding food and drinks. A more sophisticated place to have great time than any place on mill.
F3b0FXo3HguaDe6ROBSFTQ	I've had one positive and one somewhat negative experience at this location. The first time I came here with a large group for a birthday and the second time was just with my girlfriend. When we were told we had a 45 minute wait, we waited an hour for a text that never came, since they never put us on their list.  Unfortunately, while we received excellent service from our first server, our second server, Richard, was slow to take orders and get our food out. While I loved the fried chicken when I first got it, the second time when my girlfriend got the dish it was lacking its signature honey drizzle and thus, lacked some needed flavor. The restaurant was kind enough to take this off our tab since our food took a while to come out.   The pork nachos were good and the monkey bread was good as well, but nothing special. My ribs were good, not great. Ultimately, I am giving three stars because while I love the atmosphere, the restaurant seems to care more about big groups and outside of its few signature dishes, the rest of the food is only average. Considering the prices on the menu, it seems that people go for the atmosphere rather than the food.
5PdamM0wi_Rc8jsNIsehFQ	Went there based on the hype that the restaurant receives.  We had an enjoyable evening.  We started with some of the house made chips and onion dip (very good) and some chicken tortilla soup (also very good).  We moved on to sandwiches (turkey pastrami and pub burger)  also very good.  They g=have a good selection of beers and some house-specialty drinks that we tried.  The atmosphere was very busy and LOUD.  It is not a place to go for conversations unless you like to yell.  I would highly recommend making reservations as it was very busy.
qlCg6RU2n1wsGUeaWEfoLA	After attending a great show at Gammage theater today, we went to an early dinner at Culinary Dropout. I ordered one of the signature dishes ( fried chicken) that they have highlighted as being one of there best items. The chicken was not cooked fully, somewhat bloody.  The service and atmosphere was pretty good but I will not come here again nor would I recommend this restaurant.
v1RsuwTuLLe26FP95p1jVA	Awesome food and great service. Me and my bf had burgers. However, that salted caramel custard was to die for. We should have ordered two because I did not want to share. Will be back.
477DMj6t3NgzxesZqWN2GQ	This place has a great ambiance that's trendy and casual. It is family friendly before dark but even then it can be iffy depending on the crowd. It is a college hangout with ASU a stones throw away so you have a mix crowd but mostly with college kids. They have a nice outdoor area with couches and pool and bags. The food was good, service could be better and the prices vary depending on what you're there for but I guess average.   While it is cool, I felt very old and out of place even being in my early 30s with my family.
acgJzKUIhvIuCrMT3C8-uQ	Very tasty Ribeye, surprisingly good brussels sprouts.  Potatoes cooked to perfection, and a great beer selection...what more can you ask for?  Service was good, definitely a happening place if you ware looking to socialize.  It can be on the loud side, if you are looking for a quiet place, this might not be for you.    I ate here twice on a recent business trip, and no one in our group had anything left on their plates.  Everyone was very pleased with their meals.
PcgMxz37_Ksg-hI75S0oPg	Awesome atmosphere. Was a fun place for a first date! Had a good time.
OjjMjvElSACXHf5ilLLrQg	The atmosphere at this place is incredible! Ask for Maggie as your server! Easily the best service I've ever received!
aPWTEJpRlO26Ba81QtIhuw	Nice people, but I ordered ribs and they were cold in the middle. First bites ok, but then third rib and they weren't hot, rather cold. No Bueno. Otherwise big space and lots of regular bar menu items on tap, people having good time. Cold pork is no Bueno.
75kphyeJhJo-uFQBGSXKIQ	The squash pasta & Gorgonzola salad were amazing! I wasn't impressed the first time. I loved the atmosphere though. Super fun & chill!!! So we tried it again. But after my second visit I'll definitely be back again!!! Love this place for hanging with friends!
5OAmK9hpe5JMmLygoa1SiA	This place is awesome. Great vibe, plenty of space inside (bar area in the front and back), games section with ping pong tables and corn hole boards, and the food is outstanding. The custom drinks were all excellent although the bartenders at the front (main) bar were at times inattentive and aloof. If you want to get away from the crowd go to the back bar (The Coop) - better service and calmer atmosphere. For Antipasti - the meat and cheese tray was delicious (make sure you choose the small batch beef jerky as one of your options). Soup & Share - the pretzels and provolone fondue are a MUST and one order is enough to serve three people. The pork belly nachos are also solid but could definitely use more pork belly. Entrees - the 36 hour pork ribs were good but nothing to write home about. The Korean Style Ribeye Cap is solid with a nice char on the outside and great flavor profile overall. The star was definitely the fried chicken. Crispy and flavorful breading on the outside, tender and moist chicken on the inside (it comes with three pieces). Overall this concept works and provides a very enjoyable drinking and dining experience.
erdlfi56vKyBbH7CY9byuQ	Interesting place I have been twice. It is really interesting and the place is enormous. The food is good but a bit pricy for what you get. Seems a tad over priced but the size and uniqueness of the place is part of that price I'm sure.  I will be going from time to time
dLs5oM0NmhpGC8qcpN0Vnw	This place is uber fun!  It has everything you need for a fun night out.  Good food, lots of beer, good service, and a really cool atmosphere.  We spent probably 4 plus hours here.  We came a little early to get a bigger table..and we were successful, scoring an 8 seater.  We had friends come shortly after that were shown to their table (you could get lost in this place).  You can eat "outside" near a fire pit or inside like us at a long table.  The options are endless.  If you feel lucky, try the paper bag beer...It was a PBR, boom!  We continued to eat and drink while making our way to the ping pong tables and bags.  We had to revisit the bar because that's what you do ha!  All an all this place is such a good place to meet with friends, have a bday or whatevs.
uH5I9N9MrSS_-lWV8-1A2A	Very chic and chill. They have colorful cocktails with non-standard liquors and food thats not too bad. Additionally, the setup is pretty fun; outdoors they have pingpong and cornhole with another bar at the very end. Its a cool place to not go too party-ish, but only a little. I usually take my friends from out of town here for the last night.
i_6N_VfINjmjde3MdCc1ng	This place is hipster to the max!!  I mean, this place literally reeks of hipster which to some may not be such a bad thing..haha.  Overall the food was pretty good.  The fried chicken is a must!  One of the best fried chicken I've ever had.  I'd pass on the pork belly nachos.  For some reason, I expected chunks (like cubed) pork belly, but instead it was like shredded pork (sort of like pulled pork) marinated in some sauce and plopped on top of nachos.  The bacon bloody mary was pretty good although I think I've had better.
uSE-O_qYz_LG0CzkeAObuQ	Amazing fried chicken & biscuits. $18 Friendly service. Young crowd. Industrial  feel. Loud music.
19Q31YdbIA1KLuTQLG3FFg	Was in town for a quick turnaround with the Family the food was great Fried chicken hit the spot. Also tried the Porkbelly nachos must have. Good selection of craft beer and a lot of fun games to keep you entertained. Our server Richard did a great Job you need to try this place.
HR_F5a5H1cEk8kolyk4-aA	Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable on everything and could answer any question with confidence in seconds. Her describing how they made the fried chicken sold it for my wife and I. And....yea the chicken tasted like it came from back home.(im from TN) the mashed potatoes were very creamy and the biscuit just topped it all.  Great selection of beer, great live band playing in the background, and after youre done eating and chillin..go towards the back and lose at shuffleboard to your spouse..or you could win, i didnt.   Amazing place hands down. Be sure to try it out.
UeFarFo1gJ1ZyGLVI7gAGA	My first experience here and it was amazing. We came on a Sunday afternoon so it wasn't packed and there was plenty of parking.  We were seated immediately and our server was quick to get drinks and an appetizer started. The $5 pretzels and fondue appetizer was delicious, probably the best I've ever had.  Then I got the fried chicken and it was great as well. Overall it was a great experience and the restaurant atmosphere was great. I will definitely be back again.
Z0WvYL63eptk2Du_2TR8Yw	Trendy, Relaxing, and Really Good Food!   The Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places and is a Fox Restaurant Concept, generally known for more upscale type establishments.  The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy, relaxing, and cool.    My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some the pretzels with provolone fondue and it excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companion had the fried chciken, and mac & cheese and it equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.
26CmTpGymzDwsU-cKBuwYQ	Good food. Loud echoing atmosphere. Services staff that was clearly hired only for their image.  Seriously bad font of house staff. 25 minutes to get my check after I asked for it. The bartender at the bar before being sat was rude. The staff didn't know the product very well. They were mistaken about several of the beers  (styles, taste, ect.) and couldn't answer simple questions about the food. The food was very good though. Credit to the back of house, they know what they are doing.  For such a polished looking operation at those prices I expect better from the front of house staff. At least they are pretty if nothing else.
gyGBH6F6rZOIdyvHDi0Tqw	Very fun atmosphere. Great service. Good drink selection. Small menu but very good food, especially the appetizers. Good for groups. Good tempe location. Easy parking with valet avaliable.
v787rzuwrKp9gw8FHIWMzQ	I enjoy coming to this place because my 10 year old son loves it. He has Angelman Syndrome and any chance we can go out to an upbeat, fun place he loves it. The entire experience would be awesome if the servers weren't rushing their guest out. Every time we come we enjoy taking our time to relax and have dinner. Because of my sons special needs he eats slower than most people but every time we come it's like the server brings the check before we can finish our meal. Tonight was an extreme case. The girl who took over our original server was rude and pushy. She never asked us if we needed anything just brought the check before my family was even done. There are no other people waiting to sit here so why push out the guest you have who determine your tip. I appreciate the restaurant but would love a little more time to relax
QCkG2oXlyQRr-uC-WOxgmA	Food was delicious, but a little pricey for what you get. The atmosphere was a really chill area (see pictures) which would be great in the summer. The turkey sandwich was really good and fresh. My family got the reuben which were very flavorful.  The downfall of the place is that there are many ingredients on each item which could not be good for picky eaters. The service was really good, but the waiter kept taking away our drinks when we still had a 1/3 of our drinks left. I hate wasting.
CRkoQFcwjisJehfXQpsUug	Heard great things about this trendy place. I took friends that came in to Phoenix for just the day, and it being my first time too, we were all impressed.  It's got a great vibe and the happy hour specials made our bill so much cheaper than I thought it was going to be.  I can't wait to go back.
o7CZ0rs3XZdnONypBuJkuQ	While visiting town from the foodie capital of the the country (Portland), I decided to try this place out. I had lived in Phoenix for twenty years and was familiar with the Sam Fox concept restaurants. Culinary Dropout is a hybrid of Sauce and The Arrogant Butcher, which was disappointing. Many menu items were identical and in a tragic twist of fate, less tasty than I remembered.   Our service was lackluster. The server was either overwhelmed or just not interested in her job that night.   The pretzel fondue was great. The chicken gorgonzola salad lacked both the meat and cheese it promised to deliver.   The restaurant itself is a great venue to meet friends and have a great night out. Tempe has always been a town with hit and miss service.
h0ebf0Ai0xNT8ws_f6BnDw	Came here after a work meeting with a large group of coworkers. Very friendly and quick service! Excellent happy hour menu lots of options and very very yummy. I will definitely be back sometime!
RrYlYlrdx2dxJNSs-b8eSQ	Very loud, very busy place especially for a Wednesday night. Gastropub in this farmer place slash airport hangar. Menu has lots of stuff, appetizers including "make your own cheese board". I got the fried chicken plate and it was okay. Disneyland chicken is better and about the same price. The biscuit was hard and cold, the mashed potatoes were slightly salty. The best thing ? Roasted Brussel sprouts ! Very tasty.
WgWJtrDAIW6Gudv6WZkmlg	I was a little overwhelmed by the size of "the yard" when I first walked down the long dark hallway and saw the restaurant in its entirety.  And while, yes it was very loud it was a fun and vibrant atmosphere.  The service was fantastic.  I've found some "hipster" places to also have what I refer to as "rude hipster too cool for school service."  However this was not the case with Culinary Dropout.  Our service was fantastic.  Our server offered great suggestions and checked on us frequently.  We ordered: deviled eggs, balsamic beets and the grilled bread.  The eggs and beets were both fantastic.  The bread had amazing flavor but was too crunchy and tore up my mouth.  My husband had the fried chicken, and although it's not as fabulous as fried chicken in Atlanta, it was delicious.  He loved the honey drizzle and the huge buttery biscuit.  The portion size was just right for a big, filling dinner.  I ordered the Korean steak and it was prepared perfectly and had an explosion of sweet and spicy flavor.  It was fantastic.  I'm so glad I ordered the bread because it definitely needed a carb to soak up the sauce and balance out the sweet heat.    We will be back, with friends soon!  I better brush up on my ping pong skills too
-Aw47TdqPQewGkqspaO_EA	Shared the pretzel fondue, normally something I wouldn't touch but they are perfectly crisp on the outside with a freshly baked doughy center and the fondue is creamy, de andante but not too heavy.  The salads were fresh and dressed perfectly, not drenched, allowing you to taste the fresh and balanced toppings. Definitely try the Italian chopped for a savory blend.  The meatloaf is a comfort food made with quality ingredients and full of flavor. A little more upscale than grandma makes it but not lacking the true American spirit of meatloaf. Turkey pastrami is hard to find and they clearly get it right here both on the sandwich and the salads. The charcuterie is a must, they do not lack in quality on the meats or cheeses. Drinks are unique, well balanced and refreshing. I recommend trying one of their house cocktails topped with beer or champagne.   Service was better than average, the staff isn't overly friendly but they get the job done.
XsZpo47gGq0fRDB66o4yXQ	Always amazing. Always worth it.   I have been to the Phoenix location before, but this was my first time at the Tempe location. I came here for a friend's birthday, who is clearly in college.  There were pretzels, and cheese, and ribs, and live music.   It was great.    Thanks for another awesome time Dropout! :)
LoGn2uOjDJQy-O5g2QmMrw	Love, Love this place, Ambiance feels like your going to eat at somebody's home. Dishes are made to almost perfection, I will definitely come back to try all other items on menu.
4XxqjhI0Z9e9-IIbBdY0Ew	A bit pricey at times, but the drink specials are great and the food is quality. Also great environment for fun with friends.
7-ThWMguVyVowu4dy4QigQ	I did a lot of research to find a place to take my bosses to lunch since they are visiting from San Diego this week.  I did my research and this was close to my office and had great reviews so I decided to roll the dice.  I was absolutely not disappointed!  From the small plate appetizers to share to the wonderful salads we got for our entrees, everything was outstanding.  The service was friendly, the atmosphere was comfortable and the food was amazing!  I recommend the Antipasta salad.  The portion was just right and there was no shortage of meat and cheese so you had some in every bite!  Very happy and will definitely be taking my family here for dinner soon.
HOq8oBExOI1z6Uxm5KrCGg	We had a team dinner here. It was great. Food was wonderful the salads are amazing. Played ping pong, corn hole, fuse ball. Really good food and the atmosphere was fun.
HXaktG8A2jEWlD5haSTASA	The muscles for appetizer were delish . We ordered the steak and the Korean Rib eye , both spot on and delish...I really wish they made sweet potato fries, chips , or pretty much anything ... Our server Larissa was great , attentive very helpful with the recommendation.
iN6b8p5rvPthP19wcp-YaQ	Awesome service, friendly staff, and delicious food. Not to mention a badass atmosphere and stellar drinks. Meranda was my server and she was filled with info on the menu. What more could you ask for? Nothing wrong with dropping out if the food is this good.
sZs5g6qmoHYZ5EgrpsBa2g	Clubby atmosphere.  But great food and selection of beer. We had fish and chips, ribs, and tortellini.  Everything was tasty and filling.  The place is huge!  You HAVE to try the pretzels with fondue.
Iec5GD2-CXvshfFfFDknKw	This place is great. Burger is the bomb, went back again and had the breakfast special which was also great. I would eat there every weekend if I could. Cool atmosphere friendly staff prompt service.
IuyoABrUdCEgsryfoSqSWg	This place just has a cool vibe, especially the Moulin-Rouge-ish light fixtures and hipster-looking employees. I really enjoyed our antipasti choice: jamón ibérico (for the salty goodness), garlic & herb goat cheese (soft and creamy...probably the best goat cheese I've ever had!), roasted beets & balsamic (perfectly tart and juicy to cut the saltiness of our protein and richness of the cheese), and the truffle potato chips (which was "ok" but added some crunch to complete our appetizing mix). As an extra (free) compliment, they surprised us with some sweet candied grapes which worked well with our small charcuterie board. We didn't have any alcohol, but I felt a bit buzzed after completing our meal, probably from all the tyramine, haha! I personally wouldn't eat here on a daily basis, but would recommend as a fun trendy place to hang out with friends on a special occasion.
0QgQB__bL4Mfif4lkTE4KA	This place is HUGE! Couches can be reserved as well as the back room area. There was a group of 25 of us and there was a spot reserved along with buffet style appetizers. This included a large meat/cheese/nut board, small sandwiches and chips. There was an operating bar back there that made for fast service.  Ping pong tables and a bean bag toss area are here too. The paddles, balls and bean bags can be used for a small deposit/fee. This is certainly not your normal eating/drinking establishment, and that's a good thing!
8bXXXmYMgqZjvBEWqe6qKQ	The food and atmosphere is wonderful! The atmosphere is fun and comfortable and very warm and inviting. The different smells of the food are overwhelming, in a great way that makes your stomach immediately excited for food. The food itself was delicious, everything looked and smelled so good. I ended up ordering the Kale Caesar Fried Shrimp Salad and it was delicious! The server recommended getting the shrimp sautéed instead and it was a great decision. I couldn't stop eating it. Others in my group ate burgers, and they were huge and looked so good. The servings are generous and the drinks are good and generous too!
o9z6CnjOr-_WHL8eIsCFQQ	We were visiting Scottsdale from CA and wanted to use massage credits from our local Massage Envy while vacationing here. My friend and I were easily able to make our 90-min massage appointments and use credits already noted in their system. Nice and glitch free! I got a reminder call the day before which is always nice.   The receptionist was welcoming and friendly. The waiting area is really small and very awkward - and not remotely relaxing although billed as a \"quiet room\" - and felt more like a doctor's waiting room than a Massage Envy! The therapist I had was super awkward and clearly new to the job and my friend reported the same feeling with hers. We also did a Yelp check-in to take advantage of the \"free sugar foot scrub\" as promised on a hastily printed piece of paper crookedly taped to the waiting room wall. However my therapist didn't know what I was talking about - although he rallied and figured it out by the time we were ready to start. My friend did not have any luck - her therapist was quite confused and was unable to provide the service.  Not sure I would go to this franchise again - I like the franchises with owners obviously willing to invest in experienced therapists, and in making their store more welcoming and cozy.
wZLqnx4_FBrtlYEVCLukiA	Service was excellent. The food was mediocre. Shaved Prime Rib Dip ($18) was a standard ($8) French Dip anywhere else in America, French fries were cold and rubbery. A friend had Beer Battered Fish and Chips and was equally disappointed. The high prices reflect the high overhead of the place and not better food ingredients. We'll not be returning.
OXe4ECw_4eAmniarKQivmA	I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone that enjoys a great drink, an even better burger, and a bustling environment! One of my favorite things about this restaurant is that they have games like ping pong and bags (cornhole) to play with friends at your leisure. Another aspect of this restaurant that I enjoy is the decorations/furnishings. It really brings the restaurant to life. Apart from the environment, I would go back simply because my food was delicious. Not only did my burger taste delicious, it also smelled delicious! The portion size was perfect in my opinion. I am looking forward to my next visit!
6qrXABVEfjYJO69NQHjvXA	Fun place, love the outdoor bean bag toss options.  The food, no bueno however.
dc57UyYn5Znuw96kjuRjUw	This place has an amazing vibe. Love that they have a ton of couches for seating - definitely sit outside if you have opportunity. The handcrafted shandies are also worth a try. We're from out of town, but if we lived here we would be regulars for sure.
DQtULZeJUhxP_UZtUriIEg	Cool atmosphere here and I really like that the servers can wear their own clothes. Super hipster little place with a big "backyard" that has ping pong tables and corn hole. Great drinks. Delicious pretzels and fried chicken  would recommend people come check it out. When I was there Saturday night it was so easy to find parking, but Wednesday was jam-packed! Will absolutely be coming back.
D_2S4U8ONq-Nf9MNXo9VQQ	I would give it at least 4 but I'm not getting the scantily clad waitresses.  Sorry I know this a Is a college area but i wasn't choosing to go to hooters and that was the vibe despite the fact that the atmosphere is more hipster then hooters besides that the food was awesome and the service was just ok which honestly the less of the half shirt girl we had to see the better. We had the Korean rib eye and the green chili soup.  The chili was good but I was expecting a more New Mexico type chili which it was not.
zSY7lpE3cXrBVEV300wbrA	This place is great, spacious, nice staff, good food. The beef jerky was delicious, as was the deviled eggs which are the best I've ever had. The Gorgonzola salad was delicious but skimped majorly on Gorgonzola and I think smoked almonds are gross.  The Marcona almonds were standard. The monkey bread was good just not as buttery as in the Midwest.
n2cBTgZUaR2XIwZYgSu4UQ	Came here for a work party over christmas, really great space for parties. The only issue i think would be the parking. We tried to have our rehearsal dinner here, but decided it would be too difficult for our guests to find parking, and the cost of the food was more than our wedding!
r2zhPvGgKqJ4mNeP466nWA	I only went here once because I had a $75 worth of Fox Restaurant gift cards and this is the only place in Tempe... I think. Anyways, I decided to take my parents here for a nice, relaxing Saturday lunch... Not what I experienced.  We arrived and the server sat us right in front of a "band" playing music. It was waaaay too loud. I requested to move across the room immediately which they accommodated. I think they were ticked off though because our server checked up on us like once the entire time we were there until the last 10 minutes when we paid. No water refills...  We ordered mussels, their oft-posted pretzel appetizer, butternut squash ravioli, and steak. The steak was overlooked for a medium steak without much flavor, the pretzel rolls were too salty, even after we brushes off all the salt on the outside of the roll. That compounded with no water refill and we were barely able to eat them. The mussels were also overlooked so they were really tough and the sausage that was supposed to be in the mussels were like specks, about the size of crumbs. Highly misleading.   The one redeeming dish was the ravioli. It was slightly sweet with aromatic hints and well balanced. Nice dish.  The whole meal used up the $75 gift card but the one item I liked was the ravioli. My parents had one comment which I thought was funny. They said, "We're glad it was free. The Red Lobster place was better." Hah! They know an overpriced, sadly lacking in taste meal as well as any foodie out there!  I only went there once. Maybe there normal cook was out sick. I don't know but I can't think of a reason to come back...
7lRD3oK1YOO129cjsQ-pBA	Great place great food and very friendly service I recommend this place to anyone who wants great food and not all the traffic of mill ave.
C5H33PaWlm8zzKXqfo3gyA	Food is amazing. Atmosphere is fun and happening. Great place to get great food and have a good time.
6xIaBvegbNHoxNMqj6CMpQ	I was able to make last minute lunch reservations for a group of 8 for 30 minutes after my call time. I was not able to make them online for the same time though, so try calling them if you are denied online.   My lunch was delicious (I had the strawberry & kale salad with chicken) and everyone I was with seemed to enjoy their food. I did not have any, but the pretzel bites appetizer was a big hit at our table as well.   The place was fairly crowded, probably because of ASU graduations, and it made our wait time to get our meals pretty long. Someone other than our server (a manager perhaps) came over to our table at one point and apologized for the long wait.   The food was really good though. So if you've got the ability to take a long lunch, I definitely recommend this place. A little pricey for an everyday lunch spot, but this was a work lunch, so it worked well for us.
OWurSv09NmES7RwCWUc7mQ	Excellent food and the dining room was great. Live music, lots of space, and a ton of natural lighting. Too bad it's on the east side as it would be my go to lunch spot. Everything we ordered was delicious, but the fries stood out. I would recommend to everyone looking for a relaxed lunch/brunch.
hwqMnqnJfmC1JACkYhGZnQ	No idea why this place is rated so high. I have been here twice now.  Visit #1- happy hour with a coworker at about 3 on a Friday. The bar was pretty open. We sat down and it took about 10 minutes for one of the 4 pretentious bartenders to ask for our drink order.  They all had a bad case of Grumpy Cat frowns. I usually like to be greeted by a smile, especially when trying out a new spot for the first time. They watched us as we sat there waiting for service and not one said anything until 10 minutes in. Minus points for that, because service is huge for me. The sangria was ok. Pretzel and cheese were just okay but they forgot to light the candle under the cheese to keep it warm. Our party grew and we migrated to a table and our server was much better. I ordered a beer next which was overpriced. Happy hour beer pours looked teeny weeny.  Visit #2- work lunch. Server was slow and refused to go over the specials until our whole party was seated, because as he admitted, he only wanted to do it once. I ordered an iced tea which melted the ice and was never refilled. I ordered the italian chopped salad which featured too much couscous and the dressing was too little. It was too chopped, so it was less crunchy than I would prefer.  There is not a lot about this places that jumps out and wows me. The food is just ok but costs too much for what it is. Decor is nice and modern but the modern vibe seems forced and false when it comes to its execution in their food. Most of my experiences with the service have fallen under my expectations at this price point (except for the fabbo waiter we switched to on visit #1).  Both times parking sucked!
Jmcu74kHUNdiAoGAmA9OEw	Great atmosphere, food, and service! Great date place or hangout with friends. Had the room service to drink and turkey pastrami to eat. Both were yummy!
V37DxhIDNKHStj58Cn_7cw	Better than average bar food. The pretzel fondue is good for sharing with a table. I've been there several times & service can be a little slow. I've had a range of very helpful to completely inattentive servers. The enormous parking lot is a huge plus - way easier to come & go than other places on/close to Mill.  The Yard offers something for everyone - great for HH with coworkers, playing ping-pong with the family, or sitting around the cozy firepits *these can be turned off if little ones are around - not exactly toddler- friendly.
m8HNW0FTqNs7smC2wj2eQg	A great atmosphere with great workers! I went here with a friend about a week ago and loved it! We went during happy hour and snacked on some pretzels and sangria, then ordered some salads. A little on the pricey side if you're going for dinner, but totally worth it. I definitely plan on going here again. The menus big, but you can't go wrong.
1KAmM-hcHqPVbYqi4DN9wQ	I loved this location! I usually go to the one in Phoenix and this was my first time going here. I brought a friend from out of town and he was impressed with the food. The beer selection is always great and we had a nice comfy couch like booth that fit about 5 of us comfortably. Good experience, good service. I will be back.
mLaBPSUTl-O_TI5dXFWwxw	Bill Dutcher on the first Saturday of every month is tough to beat. Great location, great food, great drinks, great music.   Highly recommended.
MEiH0V1t-_g-FxwDWjYUzw	This is a very cool place! The food was outstanding. I highly recommend the ribs. We also had a fabulous waitress. We will definitely be back!
L-pGjEIikmomc1ltNLVmCQ	Excellent location, plenty of parking, and the food was delicious.  We like trying new things, so tried the strawberry jalapeño margarita (it had a fancy name but I can't remember it!) - it was absolutely delicious, as was the classic mule.  The deviled eggs were very good, and I had to try it the prime rib dip sandwich, even if it was $17.  I hate to pay that much for a sandwich, but I have to say it was one of the best I've ever had.  Our server was attentive and explained the background of the restaurant since this was our first visit & was very nice.  I only gave this four stars, because two drinks and a sandwich cost me $45.  I would love to come back again & again, but at that price point I'm not sure I can afford to - but I sure will try!
KM9mwzG43qQqfJReIeoOuQ	I've been here a few times and I really like it! The atmosphere is AWESOME! I love the live music and all the activities in the yard area. My ABSOLUTE FAVORITE  is their PRETZEL BITES with fondue!! TO DIE FOR!! DELISH! plssssss try them! Lol
A49rASo1ydUAu2iCVgcCjg	The chicken probably would have been good if it didn't taste like fish. Time to change the oil?  The crisps and onion dip were quite good, so the experience wasn't a total bust, but for the prices they are charging, I expected my chicken to taste like chicken.
I0NipqJrtZR0BPHxieWKcg	Culinary Dropout is one of my favorite places to eat at. I have never been disappointed at the quality of food. My favorite appetizer is their Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue. I have a corn allergy and have been able to eat these every time. My favorite cocktail that they make is the Spanish Apple Tango. I would reccomend anything on their menu. Their ingrediants are quality and that is pretty much the reason why I can eat there.
enZ7YGNoj92443mQ6-N5Fw	The staff is very courteous and very knowledgeable regarding drink and food taste. They go so far as to compare it to things that I happen to know and love back in NYC. The Gin and tonic #33 is definitely one of the best gin and tonics I have ever consumed. The usage of uncommon gin, with a touch I haven't seen anywhere else. The precision and craft is taken to the next level. The fried chicken, I would put up to most other places I have tried throughout the country.
wHumC7W0eD1FJHUsVCks4A	Culinary Dropout has created a very unique experience with beautiful interior layout expansive ceilings in-game area.  Unfortunately the quality of their food and service is very sub average. Most of their dishes tend to be loaded with high amounts of oil and fat which shows the attention has been taken away from health and high-quality ingredients.  I would give this a 4 or 5 because the environment and Vibe is extremely fun and well suited for families after-work outings or even dates.
tkLMAT14V1Uln1XALPLTJw	We had such a great time last time we were there.  There was a band on Saturday that was so easy to listen to and relaxing called Vinyl Station!  They sound great!  Our food was good and our waitress was nice.  Its nice to watch people having fun with all of the games, and seeing the food coming out for parties.  Nice presentation!
EfY1biqVMqb9vNBs4UbbgA	This place was cool.  Its huge has great bartenders and good live music.  Definitely want to spend more time here. its just far enough away from "mill" to be tolerable.
EcvWVk8jkRpnP0vhN8l6nQ	This place has a positive ambiance. I met a woman here for our first date and although it was very crowded (Wednesday) and we had to wait about 20 minutes for a table, once we were seated, the other tables, the crowd, and even the live music on stage were not at all frustrating distractions; my date and I were able to talk and get to know one another in peace and comfort.   Management was very prompt and attentive when my glass of water accidentally shattered as our waitress was attempting to refill it. They even comped us dessert (Monkey Bread), which was delicious.
tLxK6PCtlkq7kjWi8LcAYA	Love this place. Food is great, fun environment, live music on the weekends. I like that there's usually a mix of old and young people, singles and families. Great place to bring people visiting from out of town.   I don't love meatloaf but theirs is so good! Love the kale salad too, which is very generous.   One of our favorite spots! It does get busy during games so go early.
g4IvXSVI0phmEJ4OK-HO5A	We came here on a late Thursday night after a concert at the Marquee. This place is a wide open space with high ceilings, didn't look at the decor too much because I was tired, hungry and really wanted to go home.  Out server was nice, but he was way too "attentive", this was our first time there and while having a server explain the menu is what most people prefer, my friend and I just want to be given time to read it ourselves. He kept stopping by which made it harder to concentrate and it became somewhat annoying. Maybe he was new or we were his last table and he wanted to get our order in quickly. Once we ordered he pretty much left us alone and we enjoyed our time there.  We shared the grilled cheese sliders and the seared tuna salad. The sliders look more impressive than they taste and we only ate one each. The salad was something else! It is probably one of the most delicious salads I have ever had. Just typing this makes me want to drive down there and have one for dinner. Definitely give this place a try!
E9TnQzFh4gZ15IPoYpz0UA	Oh my God this food is amazing.  Great atmosphere and staff. Pork belly nachos, onion dip, pretzels and cheese, French dip and meatloaf taste so good it makes you want to smack your mama. My new favorite spot.
lcH-yosMfDf7qtFB7fM3xw	Went for lunch, really nice atmosphere with cool live music! Pretzels with fondue and pork nachos were amazing, left feeling stuffed.
gRjjIvkR-f11Q1GJWlaryA	My favorite place to eat in Tempe, hands down. We've been here three times and will make sure we bringe visitors and out of towners  here. It's fun, drinks, ambience, games, tvs, music and great times rolled into one night. You won't go wrong here. Great for an adult birthday gathering.
9nlEKOVPlV4FTDZIHYQfoQ	To be honest, I was expecting something more based on other friends opinions. The food was just okay, nothing super special to me. The waiter described the food like it was so unique and savory but when I tasted it, it left me wanting more. Other than that, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was fun and easy.
MZ6Sp7g8v4gGZbphHSGkUw	Food was good, not great. Our server was bad. She hardly checked on us. She took a long time to take our drink order and food order. It was not a busy day. We went long periods until they refilled our waters.
qMowELpUtl0sBEaZsmQR0g	This place is fun! The atmosphere is amazing and there is live music on the weekend. Try the fondue pretzels or the antipasta plate. They have happy hour too.
s5amuu9avCXOrZUoL3_chQ	Tough location to find off Mill however worth the Sherlock Holmes. Stopped by at the suggestion of my business partner who had a long day....until we started with the cocktails. Mule was nice however the lemon, jalapeno, nectar.   Had the pretzels and cheese (seemingly like everyone else in the joint). Bacon. Cheese. Tomato. White Bread. Butter. So good.   Food was great. Cocktails were AMAZING. Staff - ASU cute. Super clean.   Very much enjoyed Culinary Dropout.
oVx03SmPIbrI41m_tZ0U6g	Great place enjoy a Friday night. Very much liked it! A friend found this place and we decided to try it. We both had a great time and service was phenomenal.
jjrdMks21Vd9rxyy5OSt_A	Highly recommend this restaurant! We are a family of 4 on vacation! Loved it! Great service great food great atmosphere! Great prices!! Hope the restaurant comes to the east coast!! Payne our server who is a LAX player for ASU was super attentive! Can't say enough good things! So happy we came here
Ysk3vCWjOaBBw1R2GxhqUw	Highly recommend this restaurant! We are a family of 4 on vacation! Loved it! Great service great food great atmosphere! Great prices!! Hope the restaurant comes to the east coast!! Payne our server who is a LAX player for ASU was super attentive! Can't say enough good things! So happy we came here
2Lmg7D9tk-T2od7InOwJMQ	Food and service were great!  Rather pricey for a college hangout.
00CUaUVgtAI4N9q2tfE2nA	Their fried chicken is on point, go get some! Their desserts are also awesome!  I've been here several times and the service has always been great. I also like the laid-back but clean atmosphere. Like I said... try their fried chicken. You'll love it.
E_JUXQKQZsEpZvic43LPeQ	I don't know how I didn't know about this place before.. This place is very big with indoor and outdoor seating.. They have happy hour Monday thru Friday 2-5... My friend and I ordered the Korean shrimp and chicken, pretzel Fondue and pork belly nachos .. I got two beers and my friend had the sangria which all came out to be about $32.. They have few games outside like corn hole and ping pong .. We loved the atmosphere and the food was pretty good
zKRCqY8Z-aAm1AIRyO72XQ	My husband & I had a quick lunch at the Phoenix location by ourselves a few months ago & decided we had to take the kids to check it out. Since we live in Mesa we chose to visit the Tempe location by ASU this time. We are a big fan of the pretzels with cheese. The best part is that the cheese is kept warm by a small flame beneath it (we also enjoy the pretzels with cheese at The Tavern Grill & Teakwoods).  It was fun playing ping pong with them & the layout of the restaurant is very roomy.
zZNm49vdweOmh3-31uWekQ	I wanted to take my husband here when we visited Phoenix. I had been to the other location and liked it, so tried his new location....it was awesome!  The place is really cool and has an awesome vibe, with live music, good beer, and even ping pong tables and cornhole! I recommend the pretzel bites for sure! I had roast beef sandwich and my husband had the grid chicken. Neither of us were disappointed.  I will definitely go back next time I'm in AZ!
zihTK0s5j38ZvG9wtBbdYA	First timer... Had the seared tuna salad with a Gin and Tonic cocktail. It was a great first visit. Loved the atmosphere and people were nice.  Food and Drink was great! Will be back!
5NwT4d_C20ZPSrEwYmbrNA	Listen, in Tempe it's a challenge to find the "whole package" in a single restaurant but Culinary Dropout in Tempe at The Yard IS just that. A unicorn in an area of Tempe that caters to college kids. Excellent multi-use space - we had dinner on a Tues night when the lights were low and the place was hopping and went back for lunch on a Saturday when the bright sunshine poured in - high quality service and food BOTH times. The staff were friendly and seemed to really like working there. They knew the menu and were genuinely proud of the food coming out of that kitchen. I recommend Culinary Dropout at The Yard enthusiastically!
PiTzvZJx-fE53Iky1wpLZQ	Went on a Friday like we had previously for their happy hour. But apparently, "happy hour is not available on weekends only M-TH." Since when a Friday a weekend? If so, why is it part of my workweek?! They should really update their website as it is misleading. Happy hour menu displays M-F. Service and food was also subpar to what we had been accustomed to here.
5v9-AEYjjDe7szPS_pe7ng	5-stars for cool ambiance, 3-stars for undercooked chicken wings. We had a work dinner at Culinary Dropout which included a myriad of shared dishes and cocktails. I had my heart set on chicken wings which were unfortunately not cooked correctly. Kitchen mishaps happen, but of all the chicken joints in the world... why did it have to happen to mine? Other than the chicken wings dinner overall was a pleasant experience with the pretzel bites and cheese being my favorite dish! Will give it another try on my next visit to Phoenix!
Anai275HWjUpdUXnqYIumA	Tovah, our server, was fantastic. She was extremely attentive, helpful, energetic, and very quick to get things done. I ordered the salmon entree and asked her if butter was used in preparing the dish. She said that she would be sure to let the chef know to omit butter. She even went out of her way to come back and let me know that some of the chefs may choose to use butter, so to request no butter on future visits. I was really impressed by this attention to detail. I was also equally impressed by Ryan P., the bartender. He was also extremely helpful, professional, and had great energy. The service was top notch and made for a very warm, welcoming environment. I will be back and recommend to friends! It's such a great spot. Thank you!
JfaNDVEKKm4tUSk1cQ6Lag	I came here with my best friend and his wife on a work trip to Phoenix and really enjoyed it. The decor was cool, server was nice, and the layout of the restaurant was really big and open which I liked. We had the ribs, kale salad, and Thai chicken wings all which were awesome. Their cocktails looked rad so I will try one next time when I am in town.
lB5UbfOJBckCDvgoSvJNVQ	2 words PRETZEL BALLS  SOFT PRETZELS with sea-salt & PROVOLONE FONDUE $10 WORTH IT  GET THEM great place for a date or just a lunch with friends dinner is bomb always try different food every time i go their never had something i have not liked  SMASHED IRISHMAN $10 jameson irish whiskey, guinness redux, mint i almost always get this as soon as we sit down love it  i always sweat (always even in Colorado during winter) being Arizona it is always hot out they have figured it out i don't sweat or even get super warm  staff is always happy to help  wrote the same review for Scottsdale.  fist time in the Tempe location just as good if not better  staff was on point 100%
n5ub5IfRYpFlSt_T3ehPDg	Honestly, I loved this place for so many reasons.  1. Everyone was extremely helpful and looked like models. So it was hard not to stare at them.  2. Very hipster feel to the restaurant and they have live music. At night it's beautifully lit outside and not at all hot, even during the hottest time of the year. This restaurant is huge!  3. Customer service was on par! Especially for someone like me who is on crutches :(. They helped me out by opening doors and clearing a walk for me. AND did I mention how gorgeous every work is? Lol. For such a big restaurant they were well staffed. Our waitress did an excellent job.  4. as for food, I had the Mac burger. It was amazing!!! It's like a McDonald's Big Mac but taste a million times better! I loved it.  5. This restaurant is unique. If you are a tourist, this is a must go to place.   All in all, this restaurant had everything, a great crowd, a great decor and atmosphere, amazing customer service, and the food was exceptional.  Oh AND it's right downtown Tempe but has free parking for their guest!!
TNJU2u3YGxX0PrpSpm-Bug	What a wonderful experience!  The food is EXCELLENT, the service fantastic, and the atmosphere very fun.  If  you are in Phoenix, make this part of your plans.
PuV13pldo53mQWIiq2dqbw	Happy hour was great. Ended up in the middle of a shift change and never got helped after cashing out, which was the only negative. Drinks and food were all really good.
5ip1_4GmuPjTwSiCAKv02w	Good food, happy hour starts too early and ends at 5 PM but understandavle due to it's location in downtown Tempe.
S8Q77Xh9DSeGjJtM_0ITNg	Pretty good food overall and a unique atmosphere as well. This place is HUGE and set up well for groups or for those wanting to just catching a game. They also have live entertainment which was enjoyable to listen to as well.
mU4rBj0vhOdumjie1DGUYQ	I really only write experiences when I encounter a problem or am blown away by a restaurant. This one happens to be the former. I've always enjoyed myself here: great beer selection, fun games, decent food. However, last night I met up with some friends to celebrate a birthday. I had called ahead to make sure it was OK to bring a small liquor bottle (completely sealed, unopened) as a present for him, and was told it wouldn't be a problem. I've also seen this happen quite a few times before with bigger bottles and bottles of wine from other guests while I've been here before. While we were playing games, security called me over, and told me I need to leave. Security said they could hold it at the host stand with my driver's license to pick up at the end of the night, so I accepted, but was met by one of the hosts/managers a minute later telling me I need to leave.  I tried to explain myself, saying I was told it was OK, but the manager/hostess didn't seem to care. Apparently, she had "seen me drinking from the bottle" and that was not OK. I asked security to open the bag and check if the bottle was open. When he twisted the cap, you could hear the seal breaking, which suggested the bottle was unopened until that point. I suggested that I take the bag and go put it in my car so I don't cause any more problems, but they told me I need to go and they were confiscating the bottle. I, once again, explained it was for a birthday present and that the bottle was unopened, but at this point no one was listening, so I told them I was taking my bottle and putting it in my car and would come back.  After this incident, I figured the rest of the night would go smoothly, but while playing cornhole, two gentlemen on a double date were yelling at us for getting in their space. However, they were the ones moving their cornhole boards within a foot of ours, telling us to get the f*** out of the way, while barely able to control their motor functions because they were so drunk. We asked them to move and were met with more f-bombs and threats to fight us. We asked a busser to grab security to check on the situation, but security gave us a look, a wave, and didn't do anything else, while one of the dudes was stumbling so bad he couldn't walk without tripping over himself and spilling his beer everywhere, including on himself and everyone's shoes within a five foot radius.  Don't let my experience scare you away, this place is still great and I'll be back, but just think twice before you bring any birthday presents or play cornhole next to any drunk douchebags.
uW_Ec8au3zZXlQY5kOweXg	What's not to love!!! This place is a great place whether to just hang it with friends or come in on a date.    I've been here twice and both times have throughly enjoyed my experience.  I'd suggest making a reservation ahead whether calling it in or using Open Table. So much easier once you arrive.    Service has been excellent both times and the quality of food delicious. Great ambiance all around.  Great HH options and the pretzels and cheese fondue were freaking dynamite!!! Do yourself a favor and get them!!
KP4B72DNbhe1AHnQlfxugw	I ate and drank at the Coop inside Culinary Dropout. I small bar dedicated to the 21 up crowd. It was a full service bar so I was able to indulge in a adult beverage and food.   The EATS: I had the black mussels (captured in photos) with spicy sausage. The plate portion was great but each individual mussels were small (not the fault of the restaurant, just want to be as descriptive as possible for the next guest). I felt the mussels where on the bland side.  DRANK DRANK: I really had fun with this experience. The Bartender gent was patient with my indecisiveness. He put me on to the Bee's Knees cocktail (also captured in photos). It was refreshing and crisp. He explained in detail was the recipe called for and it was a perfect suggestion. Just hoped he crafted the drink in front of me just to give that extra gusto (everyone loves presentation)!
KkZM0wrz-iIA3miYNbZjLg	Update: I was reached out to by the business manager who informed me happy hour is STILL on for Friday's. She went above and beyond to ensure our satisfaction  so we will definitely be returning for more happy hours!  Went on a Friday like we had previously for their happy hour. But apparently, "happy hour is not available on weekends only M-TH." Since when a Friday a weekend? If so, why is it part of my workweek?! They should really update their website as it is misleading. Happy hour menu displays M-F. Service and food was also subpar to what we had been accustomed to here.
WHqKsdm2C8Mr4tGgvCsviQ	This place is walking distance between my apartment and Mill Avenue. It is easily one of my favorite spots to spend an after work gathering of Sunday afternoon with some friends. They have corn hole and bar games in the back of the venue and nice selection of beers indoors. I particularly like the Menu because they have a bit of everything. I like to get their cheese plate, Thai wings and pretZel fondue. The main entrees are even more expensive but I imagine still worth it because everything here is amazing.
qZXb-Fbvo9IRC_uaRBTgrA	I tried the Meze Platter, as I was not disappointed! Service was quick and friendly, and for a cafe, it was nice to have the owner Ben stop by the table. This is a great addition to Downtown Summerlin! I will be back, and can't wait to try more items on the menu!
fzbS6lbl3FKiZHbYstDNLQ	Awesome service! Food was surprisingly really good for a small Cafe. The lady with the strong funny accent at the counter was really helpful with some menu selections.
Xq-TXbkPULUJTKHKIcFn7w	I am so happy to have MTO Café open in Downtown Summerlin.  It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  I stopped for lunch yesterday after some shopping and I'm glad to report it's as good as I had expected.  I was greeted by the staff at the counter in a very friendly manner.  I was studying the large menu board above and two of the staff pointed to some smaller paper menus at the register.  I brought one of those home with me.  I selected the "Philly" their take on the classic sandwich.  You're given a number to put on your table.  The menu describes it this way.  "Skirt steak, Velveeta, red wine drunken onions."  The sandwich comes with fries.  I ordered a Coke and I was given a cup for use at their Coca-Cola Freestyle machine.  Silverware (real metal--not plastic) is available at the end of the counter by the registers and there are napkins, straws, and drink container opts there, too.  I selected a table by the east windows that overlooks the Dining Arroyo.  There's a patio there with heaters and some people were sitting out enjoying their lunches.  In a short time, my lunch was brought.  The Philly is on a hamburger style bun instead of the traditional sub-like roll and there was a good amount of fries with the Philly.    The small cubes of steak with the cheese and onions were excellent!  The fries were hot and very good.    After finishing while I was just answering some emails, a staff member came by and asked if she could remove the plate.  That gave me some work room on the table.  There is free wi-fi.  I can't wait to go back and try some more things on the menu.  Welcome to the neighborhaood, MTO!
4KMWsWuR8NxUs7ooMeNnHw	MTO Cafe has opened its second location at Downtown Summerlin, open from 9:00am-9:00pm daily.  This means that its fans can now have MTO for dinner and that's what four of us did tonight.  I've only ever had breakfast at the original location on Main Street so I've been curious to see what their other menu items are like.  Tonight's choice was the chicken pot pie, comfort food that's apropos for the fall weather.  MTO's version is served piping hot in a skillet with four buttermilk biscuits, shredded chicken, carrots, onions, celery, and leeks: so tasty!  The biscuits serve as the "crust" of the dish and it's definitely a hearty meal.  A generous serving, I shared it with the pals and they agreed that it was delicious.   This location differs from the first one in that you order at the counter and seat yourselves.  There's a flatscreen TV, a Coca Cola freestyle soda station, an outdoor patio seating area, a community table inside, as well as comfortable tables and booths.  The booths have convenient electrical outlets in the wall to charge your electronics while you dine and the dining tables have purse hooks, a feature the ladies (and men with murses) will appreciate.  Service was excellent, too.  Open just in time for the holidays, there's no doubt that this MTO will be buzzing with business, gaining more fans along the way.  Glad you're in my 'hood now, MTO--we'll be visiting you often.
-o74rU5xRgBrDDacfx0x9Q	Great experience and delicious food. The lovely young lady who to our order was sweet and gave great recommendations. I accidentally order the grilled cheese instead of the kids grilled cheese and they fixed it ASAP. The Bob Sandwich was delicious, the wings were different and fantastic, fries were thin and hot and the MTO doughnuts were mmmMM honeylicious. I recommend this place over Crave or Skinny Fats. It's yummy comfort food for less than $50.
rDgb8QoBQ2LRVFVVy8ymRQ	MTO Cafe is the hot off the press restaurant that recently opened its doors in Las Vegas's hot new shopping destination: Downtown Summerlin. After hanging out in Sabalatte, my brother and I decided to drive to Downtown Summerlin to experience MTO Cafe.     MTO Cafe is in the northern reaches of Downtown Summerlin. Two sides of the cafe give the gift of interesting views of the Downtown. The east-facing windows overlook the pocket park known as the Arroyo. The south-facing windows overlook Park Centre Drive. In daylight the Arroyo-facing seats are the prime seats. At nighttime, the Park Centre Drive-facing seats are the prime seats. From this angle the changing colors of the landmark office building put you in the heart of downtown Summerlin.   The Daniel. S-pectation:      I expected to pay a higher price than I normally would off the Strip. I expected a full service restaurant.   The Daniel. S Report of his MTO Cafe experience:      My brother and I walked into a restaurant that is more similar to Five Guys (also in Downtown Summerlin). You order and pay for your food. The cashier gives you a number to place on your table with a plastic beverage cup. When the food is ready, they bring it to your table. On the way to the table is a freestyle Coke machine with over 100 flavors to choose from.     When we walked inside, a friendly cashier greeted us. I was still undecided. The deal is there is only one burger to choose from. It is their Hangover Burger. Hmm! Should I order the burger or the ruben. The Hangover Burger includes an 8 ounce triple angus with bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, lettuce, special sauce and fries on the side ($13). I was so not up to a fried egg with the burger. "Could I order mushrooms in place of the fried egg?," I asked the friendly cashier. She communicated this with her supervisor (believe he is the owner). The answer was, "yes." My brother wasn't really gung-ho over a fried egg over the burger. They likewise bestowed his request.      The delay time between ordering and seeing the food was short and enjoyable. My eyes took in the nighttime streetscape of Downtown Summerlin with the changing colors of the landmark office building. Looking up my eyes saw the game playing on the TV Between conversations with my brother, my ears took in the dance mixes featuring the late Michael Jackson.     When they placed the food on the table, I did the Yelper ceremony of photographing my food. This picture shows a patty with a lot of lettuce alongside skinny fries with a cow dispenser in the background. The picture failed to capture the juicy angus beef, mushrooms, Tillamook cheddar cheese, mushrooms, and bacon. My sense of taste appreciated the flavorful burger where it was indifferent to the ordinary skinny fries.     My brother wasn't the only friendly person in my company. The friendly staff would consistently checkup on us. The Manager or Owner also checked up on us. Kudos to the flavorful customer service at MTO Cafe.     MTO Cafe is in a downtown that appears to shutdown between 9 and 10 pm on a Saturday night in the Holidays season. My brother and I were here up to the time that that they closed at 9 pm.   The Daniel. S  No-Spin Zone:      I walked away from my MTO Experience giving it a grade if 80% (3 stars). Here are my constructive criticism points. The price is to high for what you get. The Hangover Burger with fries is $13. You can make an argument on the quality of the angus beef. Taste wise it failed to exceed Smash Burger, Five Guys, and many of the establishments competing for the Burger dollar. With my $13 Hangover Burger, I ordered a beverage that brought the bill to $17.30. The difference brings a plastic cup of Coke to near $4. Just a little overpriced. For $17.30, there are far better deals than a restaurant that isn't truly full service. Diner at New York Chinese Restaurant is $6 less. A soup, sandwich, and beverage at Cafe Zupas is $6.30 less. The seafood combo at L&L Barbecue is approximately $4.50 less. I could go on and on. Another constructive criticism talking point is that the one burger they offer should be a selection of toppings that the customer chooses. A fried egg on the burger is unappealing for far too many taste buds.  The Exit:    I returned to the nighttime sidewalks of Downtown Summerlin with a positive impression of MTO Cafe's customer service, views of Downtown Summerlin, and Hangover Burger. At the same time I had a feeling that MTO Cafe might be a rare experience. From my experiences shared in reviews, $17.30 pays for more rewarding dining experiences.
Igh-6JHJW7m7iXJYNMkNAA	This place is going to be (already is) busy!  Its nice to have another fast-casual option in Summerlin.    We went for "brunch".  I use quotes because MTO is one of those restaurants that has a little of everything on its all-day menu.  Ordered a waffle for the kids to share, I had the Reuben, wife had some healthy looking thing with Quinoa cakes (it looked good but I didn't pay attention to the clever name), and got the chicken pot-pie for my dad. Green juice and coffee for the wife, soft drinks for me and dad. Some friends met us so I also witnessed the falaffel, the broccoli skillet, clam chowder, onion soup, and kids pancake.  The food was very good, everybody's looked appetizing and I was glad that my dad didn't finish his pot pie because it meant I got to help him with this pretty decadent dish.  Fresh chicken pieces with the veggies in a skillet topped with fresh baked biscuits... it was delicious and probably a million calories.  My Reuben was made with "corned buffalo"... I assume that buffalo is leaner than beef, from a taste perspective it tasted like traditional corned beef.    The service was friendly and timing was fine (they apologized that it took long as they had only recently opened but it didn't feel too long to us... perhaps because we weren't in a rush and the kids weren't bouncing off the walls).   A few things of note:  - 4 entrees and 4 drinks... $76... not a bargain but not totally unreasonable in my estimation.    - They have one of those new fangled coke machines that dispenses hundred of different variations.  I like these when a restaurant is not busy, but they're a major hassle when busy as you wait for one person to select their beverage and then for the software to reset... not the restaurant's fault.  - Coffee... my wife ordered a plain black coffee, when I went to the counter to request a refill I was meant with looks of confusion.  Finally someone said we are not currently set up for complimentary refills. I replied, "fine, I'll pay for it"... after a little more scrambling on their part I went back to the register with her cup, asked for a refill, was reiterated that there was a charge for refill, now replied with annoyance in my voice "got it, charge me".  Upon paying the $3+ for an additional cup of plain coffee I said to the cashier "I grasp the idea that you don't refill premium coffees such as lattes or cappuccinos but most breakfast-y places provide complimentary refills on plain drip coffee"... He apologized and took 10% of the coffee (approx $0.30)... kind of insulting.     It was a little cold on the outside patio but the heaters helped and it was nice because we could sit there and watch the kids play on the other side of the patio.  We'll be back.
wydlVqXgb8hpBG-irnR7bA	Wow, this place has some impressive craftsmanship in the food.  The flavors of the Hangover burger are perfectly executed, the medium request on burger patty was dead on, and its actually seasoned!    Great fries as well.  The BLT was excellent, but get plenty of napkins.  The bacon thick and tasty, not burned but properly cooked.   It will be interesting to see if they can maintain this high level of food, but I will for sure be back frequently to see for myself.   Great staff, super clean, quick service.  Solid 5 stars.
3F3yG-5nZH0YsQcOGEMNsA	I stopped here for lunch today and had the buffalo Ruben sandwich.  I have to say it is one of the best Rubens I have ever had and I like good Ruben.  The fries were also good, but nothing special.  A little on the high side price-wise for a sandwich at a counter service restaurant considering Jason's deli also does a really good one under $10.
ZS8N3tOar3IwHmkQmNguxw	This place just keeps getting better! I've visited the Downtown location many times and the one in Summerlin is just as great. The whole atmosphere is really cool.   I'm not lying when I tell you it's hard to decide what to get because everything is just THAT good. Everything is fresh and if you have to try something go for the Fat Elvis. You can't go wrong with a French toast sandwich filled with peanut butter, bacon, Nutella and topped off with powdered sugar.   This place opened only two weeks ago and runs like a place that's been there for years. I was greeted the second I walked in and my food came out quickly. Nothing but amazing things to say about this place!! Oh and don't forget the fried Apple rings!   Good job again MTO! I'll be back soon.
gxsFclEveyuo9DWN1Puq8w	Not only was the menu interesting, the food tasted excellent!, high recommends for the chicken pot pie and the Rueben!!
rDpmb-rVcjVwMF3W4xGn1A	Although the staff was friendly, the customer service was absolutely terrible. I ordered three simple drinks. A coffee, a vanilla latte, and a hot chocolate. We sat down, expecting our drinks to be ready within few minutes, just as we would wait at other cafes. We waited nearly 20 minutes until we finally decided to depart and demand a refund. In that time, two other groups of people were served their drinks within a few minutes of placing their orders. One party consisted of six people in which they all ordered a drink. At the demand of our refund the manager openly said,"I'm sorry. Our priorities are backwards." Um? Sir, if your priorities are backwards I'm not too sure you should be operating a cafe.
yunwU_-E2akQYKLYhT-Gng	This place is super cozy, food is amazing. I had the mto breakfast and I loved it. Staff is nice and efficient.it can be a little crowded though. If you check in with yelp you get a free cookie, kudos for that. I will be back for sure
8EIRF5eQH6azbODsgxPk5w	Stopped in for a sandwich while holiday shopping. Was first time customer and the counter clerk suggested the turkey melt. Was supposed to be on sourdough bread but just looked like regular toast to me. Turkey was sliced very thin and just tasted like processed turkey you buy from Oscar Mayer or something. Topped with wafer this slice of tomato and ugh.... Shredded iceberg lettuce. What is this a Big Mac? Did not smell appetizing in the least. Someone brought it to my table, dropped it without so much as a word and took off. Three stars for this is generous I tell you.   $17.40 for a not so good turkey sandwich and a coke. This includes a 15% tips that is put upon you when you pay, the option of tipping on the electronic screen. Why are we tipping order takers? Tipping is for people who the IRS takes taxes from in advance for estimated and expected tips. This is not the case with cashiers or cooks. Such is reserved for waiters and waitresses, taxi drivers, etc., who often receive below minimum wage pay and have to pay tax on anticipated tips whether they receive them or not.
-hjZ8P_oz5L1tOp4Soll5w	This is one of the new locations in the Downtown Summerlin Mall. Excellent location and beautifully modeled.   This place seems to be very busy, which is excellent for them. When you walk in, it's an order and seat yourself type of joint. #1 reason why I will tell you this place is overpriced.  Also overpriced because it's off the strip. You would expect these kind of prices on there, but not for the regulars in town that's far enough from the strip.  Another thing I'm not much of a fan of, they have shared seating here. Which is okay for some places, but a place like this? Probably not. It's so small in here as it is. People tend to take odd chairs and leave room for 1 person when if they could have scooted down just one, it'd make so much more room for parties over 2 people. It's too hard to leave easy things up to people because they'll fuck it up every time.   The food here is good. I will say that and that is was pretty quick.  Overall, just for a lunch with 2 drinks costed us $41.00 plus tip. That's a little much in my opinion. For the location, the food and the fact that you serve yourself, seat yourself and they have a tip on the receipt is just asking a lot of people.    We had -  The Hangover Burger Grilled Cheese Clam Chowder  Clam Chowder: Delicious. Some of the best we've had in town. Full of clams, good sauce that's not so creamy that you have to force it down. Grilled Cheese: I was not a fan at all. I probably should have read the description better because I couldn't even eat it. It was just such a bizarre combination of flavors and I do not ever NOT finish my dish. The cheese is not melted, it's half walnuts and the bread is toasted with honey. It was so sweet and odd.  The Hangover Burger: Delicious. The flavors were all meshed in an tasted excellent. The bacon was nice and crispy and the flavor of the beef was very flavorful. It was very messy, but very well worth it. Oh, and those fries...FREAKING amazing!  The customer service was fine, I just don't know if I'm okay paying a tip when it's not sit down service. But, some people don't agree with this.   Overall, it's a nice location, modernly decorated, nice people, good food and excellent for a quick hot meal. Just be expecting to pay prices for sit down service.
OJYd9CoivRWkvvGw7vBO7g	The MTO cafe is another great addition to the dining choices at Downtown Summerlin. In door and patio dining are available. The indoor space is brightly lit and has comfortable seating. Ordering and payment is done at the counter and you are given a number to be placed on the table. Our order was taken by a friendly staff member and the food is delivered to the table. Refreshment are unlimited and self serve. Upon our arrival for lunch only one person was ahead of us but after sitting down the line grew to six people. Food preparation is not fast delivery food but made to order. After our food was delivered a staff member returned to check on our satisfaction.   Th Rueben sandwich was an ample size and comes with pickles on the side and skinny fries. The sandwich was juicy and tender. The special sauce is fantastic. A nice rye bread complements the sandwich. The BLT sandwich was huge. Very tasty and half was taken home. This sandwich also comes with skinny fries that are soft inside, firm outside and not greasy. MTO serves breakfast, lunch and dinner. The menu has many choices that we look forward to experiencing on future visits.
kw0rrntNL9Os0NmewQDrWQ	Their food is quite good; there are lots of reviews that attest to that.  But this review is specifically about their awesome customer service.  I had ordered a salad with dressing on the side to go for my friend.  When I got back to my house and she started eating it and noticed that there seemed to be dressing all over the salad.  So I took it back to MTO Cafe (luckily, we're only about 5-7 minutes away) and upon explaining the situation to the manager, she promptly said, "I want to make this right; is it alright if I get a new salad made for you and refund you for the first one?"  I wasn't expecting the refund and was taken aback at that and she said that she felt bad that I drove home and had to drive back.  We walked over to the register where a gentleman helped me with the refund and explained to me that the salad had dressing and an aioli.  He said it was completely reasonable to expect that someone who wanted dressing on the side would also want the aioli on the side, and apologized for the mix-up.    MTO Cafe went above and beyond for us today, definitely making a great impression on me and my friend.  We'll definitely be back!
jSFVrlwqZ2qsKqPbgE06OA	I absolutely love MTO Cafe.  Their food is healthy, fresh and yummy.  I highly recommend it.  David the manager is especially awesome.  He always welcomes me and makes sure my dining experience is great.   I will definitely be back.
6_BZE4cKwrIjdnbuBvGheg	MTO is fantastic! Great food and great service! The manager David is awesome! They have both healthy food and comfort food! Great place for kids!  Check this place out you won't be sorry!
UONfa55HvjcwPR2k0rozOw	He got the Turkey Melt (avocado, tomatoes, jack & cheddar, chipotle aioli on sourdough + fries). "It tasted like McDonalds." An interesting association...  I got The Hero (grilled chicken, prosciutto, salami, arugula, basil pesto, balsamic, red onion on ciabatta + fries). Due to preference, I didn't care for the texture of the prosciutto. I also found the sandwich to be too dry.  The skinny fries are cool though.  Maybe there's something here that's really good and will keep us coming back. I'm not too excited to keep trying, but I'm sure I'll be back again due to convenience.
MgeiSemfT4X9pgIiuQw7Bw	Good eating!     So this place is the kind of walk up order food then they serve you. I don't know what that is called....hmmm. The food is actually good. I had the tomato basil soup with a strangely small grill cheese. I say this because the soup portion is out of proportion to the grill cheese. You kind of want a little more to deal with all that soup. I don't know crackers  or something? My friend had the chicken pot pie and was in seventh heaven . For a cold night it hit the spot. The mac and cheese is good but they do use a lot of velveeta so the flavors of the other cheeses fade a bit. Definitely will eat here again. Not overpriced and definitely a great stop to eat. Fun drink machine and helpful workers round out a positive experience!
YgxsbPCjAde1ZWKDG7oXlA	A cute cafe with some big flavors.   For our first visit we ordered a grilled cheese which was no ordinary sandwich as it came with Brie, walnuts and honey (absolutely loved it) and a simple salad (it didn't have a lot of anything and was too simple) with a queso carne sandwich of skirt steak, velveeta, red wine onions & fries (everything was delicious).   With our yelp checkin we received a free chocolate chip cookie but unfortunately it was burned and too hard around the edges. I still appreciate the freebie.   With the prices a tad high I expect a little more. The environment is very comfy and I would go back to try some other items as I had a difficult time choosing what to order because a few things got my attention.
Ofn3O3K1fCTX9m_AHGFrfw	I really enjoy walking into an establishment and being greeted warmly. And that's exactly how it was here when we walked in for breakfast. Even though it was crazy busy inside the staff all had smiles and were nice and friendly! That makes a huge difference!   Now let's get to the food! I only got the 5-cheese Mac n cheese due to not being too hungry but oh my lord was it DIVINE. I consider myself a Mac n cheese connoisseur and this was one of the best I've had yet! The favors were delicious! And you could tell all ingredients were fresh! Score! The wife had the Sustainable Salmon omelet and she enjoyed it. On a scale of one to ten she gave it a 10. She too enjoyed the atmosphere and food.  We will definitely be making another stop here in the next few weeks to try some more of the awesome looking menu!
sPj75_47nn0vBO6hGgowGg	Have heard great things about their original location, but Downtown Summerlin is far more convenient for me- décor is on the hipster side with birds, natural wood, and far too many chairs around any given table. Also, apparently ketchup is frowned upon? More on this later.  Menu has several breakfast choices, of which I am not a fan. The soups and salads are all solid, but the sandwiches are hit or miss- please note that the Philly comes with Velveeta, which will put off many people (myself included). The Hero is delectable and a generous portion, too. The same can be said for the sea salt fries it is served with- the kitchen is a bit heavy-handed with the salt flakes, and despite the presence of Cholula at the condiment bar, I had to ask staff for ketchup. Who had to ask the chef to bring out a ramekin from the kitchen. For KETCHUP. At a place that serves FRIES. Found this incredibly odd and awkward.  The 5 cheese macaroni is one of the best I've had with a good, thick roux and curly cavatappi noodles. However, for a $7 side it's practically an entree it's so rich. Recommend cutting the portion and price to make it a side, and maybe offering an additional $9 portion as an entrée, perhaps with a protein.
-0kAfnH8rlRVfUa6UfrqQg	I had the Hangover Burger. I'll break it down by ingredient, you'll see why.   I can't comment on the bun since I ordered it without one, but that wouldn't have affected my review. The ingredients are as follows: bacon, fried egg, Tillamook cheddar, special sauce, and fries.  Bacon: great. Cooked perfectly, tasted good. The quality of food I expected from a place like this.   Fried egg: amazing. cooked perfectly, seasoned perfectly. If every egg I had for the rest of my life was like this egg I would be happy. I typically order my eggs "over medium" and very few people ever get it right. This came out just shy of a perfect over medium (that's what I assume is the standard way, as mine and my wife's were both that way and we didn't specify any particular cooking method when ordering). While it was shy of over medium, it was perfect for a burger.   Tillamook cheddar: great. This is pretty good cheese. Back when I ate cheese by the pound this is what I would get. Good stuff. Hard to mess it up though, as it's a specific brand. I got exactly what I expected from this.  Special sauce: this was basically cole slaw. It was awful. Tasted like more sugar than anything, I immediately removed it all from the burger. Hugely disappointing, and incredibly over-sweet. Was also really runny.  Fries: just absolutely awful. Easily the most disappointing part of this meal. Taste extremely cheap and low quality. Very little salt, very little flavor other than that flavor you get when you know these fries are some cheap crappy bulk freezer section bag that have been reheated and left under a warming lamp for hours. Just awful. Terrible.  Hamburger patty itself: the flavor was only okay, but it is very visually unappealing. Looks like, again, something super cheap from the freezer section of a crappy grocery store. Blatantly pre-pressed and pre-formed. However, I asked for it cooked medium and it was cooked perfectly. Seasoned well, but the meat itself can only be dressed up so much. Both visually and in flavor.  On the plate, there were also two kinds of "pickles". Definitely not my style. I tried both styles, expecting a pickle and getting something from the first that tasted more like a super-slightly-pickled cucumber, and from the second that again tasted like a more-pickled-but-covered-in-sugar cucumber. They were both very not good. I was able to eat the first, but I had to immediately spit out the second. Totally gross. I don't understand why the sugar featured so prominently, cucumbers are sweet on their own and pickles are not. These were not a good combination of flavors.  It's kind of sad to write this review, as the burger's flavor combination with the egg and the bacon and cheese really went well together, but the cheapness of the patty and the extremely disappointing fries make me suspect the quality of all the ingredients. The food is all cooked perfectly. Somebody in the kitchen obviously knows exactly what they're doing. The egg and bacon and patty were all expertly executed. What they don't understand is that quality ingredients are important, apparently. I will not be back here any time soon.
5C8VRVwfzuw4-arhzxih5A	Went to Downtown Summerlin location based on a recommendation. Arrived about 8:30, web says it opens at 8. Doors locked, employees looking at us from inside, don't bother to come to the door. Went to another door. Employee sitting a table drinking coffee doesn't come to the door. Apparently they were closed and it was too much of an effort for one of the employees inside to come to the door on a cold morning and let the 3 customers know why. With the growth of restaurants in Summerlin, this is the fastest way to grow bust. I typically write a review after I've dined in the restaurant but in this case their behavior speaks to me about the nature of this place. Doubt we will give it another try, too many other options.
2n5KhhLWmhh5cor8yuElAQ	The young lady that took our order was very polite and pleasant. ThIs was our first time here so we had a lot of questions. Every time that we asked a question, Diana would jump in the conversation to answer. I believe she is the boss. Maybe if she quit micromanaging her employees, they could flourish on their own.   I ordered the MTO breakfast.  I ordered scrambled eggs but was brought over-easy. No big deal. It was corrected and brought back.   The coffee was warm but far from hot. Diana said that she made the coffee when she first came in. Ya I could tell. The next cup was much better.   As for the food, it was pretty good. My wife had the broccoli omelet and said that it was incredible!!  My MTO breakfast was pretty good.   I would definitely comeback but have something different next time.   My advice to Diana would be to give your employees a little more freedom to answer questions that are directed to them. They are friendly and intelligent. Remember, there is a reason that you hired them.
N3TvIity8zheod679qQdag	I still haven't had anything exceptional...  Red juice: beets, arugula, pomegranate, lime, red bell pepper, carrot Broccoli skillet: egg whites, spinach, cheddar, jalapeño, mushroom Chicken & Waffles with fries.   I would not get the red juice again. The bell pepper flavor is totally overwhelming.   My skillet was ok. I didn't taste any jalapeño, which was disappointing. The whole thing lacks any significant flavor. I could hardly taste the broccoli; that leads me to wonder if it was steamed/boiled beyond flavor. Oh, and the pile of salad leaves on top was comical. "Let's just toss some of these over and call it fancy." This dish is missing some pizzazz. I would improve it with better potato seasoning and broccoli with flavor.   Fiancé said the C&W were good. The gravy bland, but "overall good." Those skinny fries are always enjoyable though!
Ke5SBmHbBUb6kePXysub4w	MTO cafe is one of the new additions to the Summerlin mall. This is a small cozy cafe. The food is good and the ingredients are very fresh. We ordered the Turkey Melt and the Hero Sandwich. They were very good, I'm not sure which one was better. The bread was soft and crunchy and the portion size was very good. I'm not sure if the value is there though. We end up paying $30 bucks for two sandwiches which seems a bit more than your average cafe. You have the option to change your fries for salad or fruit at an additional price. I guess there is not much of an encouragement to pick healthy options. I got the simple salad and that is exactly what I got, a simple salad. Lettuce, one sun dried tomato and balsamic vinaigrette. The vinaigrette was good, but nothing crazy to it.  I felt the cafe offered a lot more breakfast options than lunch. A lot of the dishes had eggs, which made the selection a little bit more difficult!  Overall, a decent cafe if you want a salad or sandwich.
g8ocHe72xqc9BcFE_YLCKw	Food was pretty good.    Philly sammich: 4/5 Waffles: 4/5 Cheese kids sammich: 3/5 Apple donuts 4/5  Service: 5/5  My only complaint was the size.  The restaurant is small, and walking in between the tables were a challenge.  They seemed to be losing alot of business while we were there.  People would walk in and walk right back out because there were no tables available.
6fz11JHE5HK8QumAvAZqbA	I have found my MTO breakfast. What a success.   Seasonal Berries Waffle: blueberries, blackberries, strawberries.   Much appreciation for the fact that the little whipped cream topping was not cavity-diabetic coma inducing-sweet.   Comes with a little side of maple syrup too (also not over the top sweet).
NLFTDgBAm8y95eLrwJpbnA	I've been really wanting to try this place out since I would always pass by the dtlv location. I finally had a chance while shopping in downtown summerlin, and I am mind blown of how delicious it was!   I had the MTO breakfast and I was not disappointed. It was also A LOT of food, which is always a plus, along with a hazelnut latte, also very delicious. It came with about 4 different kinds of meat, hash browns, eggs and toast, pure deliciousness!   I was absolutely amazed at the hash browns, They had mashed potatoes in them!!! I will most define you be coming back to try the rest of their menu!
HZ7aE7AgCvnnxrvo7Xfttw	The restaurant is well done & trendy. Great spot. Menu is certainly big enough and should have something for everyone. I've eaten here twice this week. Had the Philly cheesesteak. It was really awesome. Perfectly cooked. Today I had a Ruben sandwich which was also very good. Well trimmed, so not fatty. My only complaint is it seems a bit pricey. $17 for  lunch without a server.  But the food is really good. So...  I guess I'll pay!
a2PshLqOuqfykJfUbl-AJg	So glad to have an MTO Cafè approx. 10 minutes away!  Ambiance: The weather today was perfect for outdoor seating! ...But even if one chose to sit indoors, there is still plenty of natural light and they aren't blasting discourteous music (these are two factors I will always appreciate in any dining setting). The interior is trendy--that mod-retro feel with industrial accents. There are plenty of warm hues to make you feel hungry!  Service: What a friendly staff; they're always up to speed. When a customer leaves, the table is cleared within seconds. Everyone smiles--this is a good sign!  Food: You peruse the menu and order up front, are given a number and, then, you seat yourself. Orders come out of the kitchen pretty quickly and a majority of the menu items are a hit! I definitely appreciate the thought put into these flavor profiles. I recommend the KFC and the Philly. I urge everyone not to just eat the food, but to taste it.  MTO Cafè is an excellent addition to this neck of the woods.
zlXhShwCmvcFbW8yjgW1ig	Yummy comfort food. The deconstructed chicken pot pie is awesome, wonderful gravy that soaks into the biscuits. The grilled brie cheese sandwhich is creative and perfect for a sweet tooth.   Only downside is parking sucks.
2CAnYVSWgbpMchzKggmfgw	Great food and super fast service from the ladies but I did notice the manager (I assume) playing on his phone behind the counter.  If your not going to help them get out of view of customers.  The chicken pot pie was scrumptious!
b4uv3XN6k0Z633XpFzTfBg	Pros: -Good portions -Friendly staff -Parking outside the store if your lucky -Cream in their hash was a little surprise     Cons: -Tip jar up front and no way to tip when you pay with card! (I never have cash -_- )
7CZajE1ziD0kP1t3vbbE_w	I decided to check this place out with my coworkers. It's a cute, bright, modern, casual, hipster joint where you order at the counter, they give you a #, and bring out your food. We ordered the chicken in a waffle, queso fundido, 5 cheese mac-n-cheese, and an avocado skillet. Our food came out fast, probably less than five minutes. I enjoyed everything I tasted. Service is efficient and they came by often to check up on us and take away our plates when we were done.  The only thing that threw me off - I was going to get a cup of soup with my mac-n-cheese but was told they only offer bowls so I didn't order soup. I didn't want to eat that much since I was already ordering a heavy, comfort meal. It bugs me when restaurants don't offer what's in writing. Other than that, I thought the food was good enough for me to come back. My coworkers and I liked it so I'm sure we will be back.
roXpHZrg6t-We_5UOfIBNg	Came for lunch at the MTO Café on a Monday afternoon (MLK day) and it was extremely busy.  That was okay with me because you counter order, then get a number so your food can be brought to you.  The long line gave me a chance to peruse the paper menu before I could read the menu board at the counter.  They have both indoor and outdoor seating, but the outside tables were in the shade at that time, so I was glad a table opened up inside when we were ready to sit down.  It was a nice day, but a little chilly walking around Downtown Summerlin, so it felt like a soup and sandwich day to us.  When we got to the counter, we were told that, while the menu includes both cup and bowls of soup, they did not have cups available.  Okay...so we ordered bowls.  This was definitely not a cheap lunch.  2 orders of soup, sandwiches, and sodas was $50.    I ordered the tomato basil soup, which was hot, rich, and hearty.  It says it comes with "cheddar toast", which I assumed was like a crustini, but it was actually a sliver of regular grilled cheese...and it was really good.  The soup and "toast" was a meal, I didn't need anything else.  But on to my sandwich.  I ordered the Grilled Cheese.  Unlike the kind that came with my soup, this one consisted of brie, honey, & toasted walnuts on brioche.  I was trying something outside the box for me, but I'm not sure why I thought I would like this.  I really think this sandwich will appeal to a lot of people, but it's just not for me.  However, the side salad that came with the sandwich was Amazing.  Baby greens, roasted peppers, a fantastic balsamic.  Yum.   The BF ordered the calm chowder and he said it was one of the best he's had in Vegas.  Both for flavor and the mass amount of actual clams in the dish.  This chowder was enough for a meal, but he has also ordered the Hero sandwich.  It has grilled chicken, prosciutto, salami, and a mix that looked just like my salad.  He took most of it home, but said it was terrific.  All in all, we enjoyed the fresh space, the food, the Freestyle Coke machine, and we will be back sometime when we take the 40 mile journey to Downtown Summerlin.
qdf2n1pzbyDnNwcTSKSHyA	A mistake. The food was heavy and greasy. I had The Bob which was not nearly as light and organic as it sounds and James had the Mac and cheese which was only ok. My latte was essentially a cup of milk with some coffee in it--almost no foam. Overall everything was definitely not worth the $30 it cost. At all.   I will say that all the employees I encountered were very nice and friendly but for the food, man, I REALLY do not recommend this place.
zmWOZd-qmE16L4pwQXpRcQ	You can't seat your customers because you're open yet closed because your staff is watching Superbowl?  Turning away business for some arbitrary reason?  We were going to join our friends for lunch until we heard they gave this flimsy excuse!  Seriously!
QGCdgik9Ft5JBzfutlkOOA	Stating from the day it was announced that I felt MTO Café was the most relevant restaurant on the list of eateries at Downtown Summerlin it is with some shame that it took so long to visit after the store's opening, but having enjoyed Chef Johnny Church's breakfast creations at the Downtown location several months prior I'm happy to report the dinner selections in the shadow of Red Rock are just as well done.  Eschewing traditional tableside service and instead implementing a system similar to that of Panera, where guests order and pay at a counter before waiting briefly at their table for Made-to-Order creations, it was with a specially requested tasting menu that my experience at MTO Downtown Summerlin took place and leaving selections to Midwestern Chef's discretion the plates presented frequently took me back to my childhood - memories of roadtrips espoused by some things while upgrades on traditional comfort foods were found in several more.  Beginning with flavored waters from the restaurant's FreeStyle machine - the Peach Dasani particularly lovely, round one began with a sharable tray of Mediterranean dips as well as salads and while the tabbouleh was not particularly my style all three of the dips were absolutely top notch, the smoke-imbued eggplant amongst the best I've ever tasted while edamame added a crisp, vegetal tinge to hummus atop piping hot pita.  Conserving capacity to maximize the experience, round two consisted of three soups served in espresso-style shooters and although the clam chowder may have benefitted from just a touch more brine the cream-style tomato and heavily cheese-topped French onion were both reference standard, a similar compliment applicable to the KFC Breakfast, a juicy breast of chicken beneath herb tinged double-crisp batter atop a pile of pan-seared mashed potatoes all beneath a veil of country gravy and an over easy egg.  A bit leery of rumors that the Chicken Pot Pie was substandard as the biscuit-topped version represents a favorite for myself and pretty much everyone outside of Dutch Amish Country (and those who consider Swanson or Banquet to be quality cuisine) I'm more than pleased to say that the version served by Church and Co. is something many Southern Grandmas would be proud to call their own and with both the stock and chicken teaming with herbs while the carrots offered sweet balance an equally deft plate was executed in the case of Meatloaf that opts not so hit diners with a sledgehammer of false flavors from truffle oil, but rather to dig deeper and provide an aromatic topnote to tender veal beneath flavors both smoky and sweet alongside tender orange gnocchi.  At this point admittedly getting a bit full it was thankfully a downsized portion of the vegan spaghetti squash that arrived and again focusing on nuance, with the sweetness of grapes and carrots used to offset the earthy flavors of beets and curry, one would be hard pressed to find any fault in a plate adhering to such dietary standards - the side-dish of fresh sprouts perfectly cooked, though a bit too spicy from horseradish for this diner's tongue.  Not particularly focused on plated desserts, but instead offering fresh-baked cookies and several pastries available throughout the day, it was with two boxes of goods that I took my leave after a long chat with the Chef and his team and indulging in some after the walk home with others saved for the following morning it was somewhat disappointing to find the poppyseed muffin almost inedibly dry, though the rest was just as good as the majority of the savories - both the brownie and almond pecan scone particularly memorable with soft texture and bold flavors while each of the cookies were far better than those offered at Wonderland Bakery...at less than one-half the cost.  Admittedly a bit pricey for a 'quick casual' place, yet at the same time far friendlier in service with both produce and proteins sourced from local sources as Chef Church is a regular at the local farmers markets, MTO Café is precisely what Downtown Summerlin visitors should support - a local business committed to doing things right, not another offshoot from elsewhere willing to mail it in and make bank.
FszKbhIcytxaHjVI5wMTtw	I stand corrected, I've been back three times because this little cafe has excellent food. Breakfast is outstanding, try the pancakes or steak and eggs. Dinner very good, in fact I'd rate the quality of their food product better than Crave next door. Give it a try!
FzOnlZI6Sskw_z7S6yK1uw	This was our first time venturing to downtown Summerlin. This cafe was excellent. Service was friendly and attentive. Food was delicious. They serve the breakfast items all day. Decent kids menu. Options of menu choices were fair in terms of number of different items, but what they do make was delicious. Lots of choices from the fancy soda fountain. I liked that there were non-carbonated items for the kids too. Ambience is contemporary and modern. Overall, we had a great experience and plan to return in the future.
d-0w6y_0k0EmXdOgfSvWFg	The food was ok, nothing special. The portions were small, we had to go some place else and get snacks because we were still hungry. The food was way over priced, $13 for one waffle and flavorless fruit was ridiculous. I wouldn't go back. The only saving feature was that the atmosphere was nice.
acase7AglAOmKpcS596ryA	This is a casual place where you can get a quick breakfast or lunch. I've heard good things about this place and decided to give it a try.   Food:  1.Hangover burger (3/5): it was bland and burger was bit dry. Only delicious factor was the bacon.   2.Chicken in a waffle(2/5): chicken was tasty but waffle was so soggy.  Overall, food was not the best but their bacon is quite delicious so I might come back and just get bacon and eggs.
4rQyVDHlHNZ28hOwDKglhQ	I love the food at MTO - Downtown more than this location. They pretty much have the same menu items but for some reason the execution isn't the same.  Banana Nutella Muffin: I had such great expectations for this muffin that I bought 3 for me, myself and I - we were all disappointed. Me thought it lacked Nutella. Myself added more Nutella on the 2nd muffin. I didn't waste any more time and calories on the 3rd muffin and just tossed it. I mean, if you're going to put key ingredients onto the name of the menu item, those ingredients better exist! You can taste banana but the Nutella was lightly drizzled on top of the muffin - so sad. The muffin itself lacked texture and was very dense and dry. I'm not expecting cupcake...but a muffin should not be like this at all. 1/5  Turkey Melt: Turkey, avocadoes, cheese and tomatoes. Comes with fries and pickles. Nothing crazy, nothing fancy, nothing extremely different, nothing noteworthy. 3/5  What you should definitely try: Hangover Burger, skillets, Fat Elvis and apple rings. Those are good!
-8xF2hnvzNq4xLvMJy20jA	First time here, I'm trying the teriyaki turkey burger and lolu wings.  The wife is trying their honey walnut grilled cheese.   MTO - made to order, so your order - take a number and wait.  Comes out as its finished so you may not get it all at once.  Turkey burger - pretty good, no flavor grenade, but if you like turkey burgers, you won't be disappointed by it.   Wings - they advertise a ginger / franks red hot mix. Taste like standard wings , which I like - but nothing special if your looking for something new.  Grilled cheese - was awesome (I stole a bite), sweet, cheesy. I'd get this every time from now on.   ** in the dining arroyo in downtown summerlin shopping area. nice outdoor seating area.
O9VeFnwhe-pnXEYfNP-D5g	We're always looking for new breakfast places to try, so decided to venture out to this cafe. I was disappointed in their limited breakfast menu, they basically have a few omelets and the standard  3 eggs and choice of meat items. The cafe is small and you order at the counter. They have outdoor seating but no awning or umbrellas to help give you a bit of shade. Since nothing on their breakfast menu was appealing to me, I ordered the vegan falafal and my partner ordered the Kentucky fried chicken breakfast. He said that his breakfast was ok, but nothing he would order again. My falafal on the other hand was absolutely delicious. The falafals were very flavorful and I loved the light basalmic tahini sauce, it was just right and did not overpower the falafal, it comes served on a bed of mixed greens in a wrap of soft bread. I would definitely come back for this.
vEQdpEuJFKGWKr-Vl6qp-Q	I like coming here to have breakfast around the Summerlin area after we hit up Costco on our weekend shopping.  I like the bacon pancakes.
hKacnqjSED3yVECE87TrSg	Coffee, coffee, coffee...doesn't have to be Sambalatte quality but match Micky Ds. I'm hoping I just had a bad brew, but if you serve breakfast offer a solid brew. I'm all for do it yourself, but put the cream and sugar on my TABLE I don't wanna have to get up and go to the counter if I have another cup because the first one was weak. Done with that rant. Food was awesome,  waffles were fluffy, and the mto breakfast was cooked excellent. The best thing here: MASHED HASH BROWNS absolutely something to start your day eating a hybrid of chive mashed potatoes and crispy hash browns. I'll return, but its not the best breakfast I'd had in Vegas. Best in downtown Summerlin though. Ha!
uySRHgN4-q7pscwSJPQp0w	This is one of my favorite spots to eat at in Las Vegas. The food is outstanding and in my opinion, affordable for what you get. I've had the hangover burger, which had so much flavor, and the fried egg added a great touch! But the most delicious dish I had was the B.L.T.A.E! If you come here, you absolutely need to order it! They give you a big portion and everything in the sandwich is heavenly! MTO is the place to be!!
jhWtOu7iahK4VzpK1hivkA	MTO Cafe is easily one of the best places in summerlin. Every item I've had has been delicious. My conclusion is that these chefs are way over qualified and I'm glad I get to enjoy their cooking regularly. Each meal seems to be so clean and well put together, As if only the best ingredient had been  hand picked individually to create the meal.       I recommend this fine establishment to any and all who are looking for an overly delicious meal at a fraction of the price it's worth. To include to an already fantastic eating experience, the staff is as good as they come. Carrying themselves with professionalism, each employee exceeds all standards by having excellent attitudes, genuine politeness and always having a welcoming smile. MTO Cafe has the recipe for success, others should take note. Well done guys and gals, well done.
du89QxaW14sEXBtuqDEs8g	great healthy food for great price!!! huge portion. i love this place. worth my first yelp review
Jv6kR4txtD8re7UZ0_abAw	Bland.  Boring.  Weird open-faced BLT that was more bread than anything else.  I was there when they were still fairly new in this location.  Not in a rush to return, but would be open to giving them a second go.
bZpz3IajHlmERW61MQMRUw	Counter service. The people that deliver the food ask if you need anything else, but don't mean it. We didn't know where the silverware and napkins were so when they dropped of our food, we asked for utensils. She said, "they are on the counter." and left. They dropped of my dad's pancakes without any butter. The bussers were extremely rude. As we were standing up to leave, I was gathering my baby's things, the busser asked us to move so he could clear the table. I understand needing the table, but they couldn't wait the 30 second for us to leave. The food is incredibly bland, and I ordered chorizo, an item that is typically full of flavor. My husband ordered chicken and waffles, the country gravy tasted like flour. My mom had the avocado omelet. The avocado was still hard since it wasn't ripe enough. My sister ordered an omelet that came with a side salad. That "salad" consisted of no more than 7 leaves and no dressing (see photos). I literally laughed. It looked like an incomplete garnish. Definitely pass on this one.
SCdQ4WkUZ71Y3ViENgzM1Q	After shopping in downtown Summerlin we decide to grab a bite to eat! The line wasn't bad and we actually got a seat on the patio. I waited 30 minutes to get a turkey wrap. My friend that was with me, ordered before me never received his meal (Chicken wrap). I finished my entire meal before he got up to speak with the manager. The manager stated that his meal would be the next one up. At this point he was beyond hungry so we waited around another 15 minutes . Still after 15 minutes he still hadn't received his meal, so we asked for a refund and left! All in all they have the WORST customer service I have ever seen. The fries were about all I could care for. If your looking for some good fries and bad customer service this is the place to go!
gYcit684Ojmgf_ZWe2gIfw	We went here for a little brunch to celebrate a family holiday. I ordered chorizo & eggs in a skillet. Now I don't know where you come from but a breakfast skillet that I am used to is totally full with eggs, meat & potatoes. I would be surprised if this was a two-egg omelet because it was in the middle of a skillet with a tiny amount of hash browns & a smattering of chorizo & small amount of avocado. All this for $11 & I had to eat again afterward because it so small. Now come on MTO give your customers what they paid for & put some more food on the plate!! I know food costs & breakfast is the highest margin meal to serve!!
65vbKHfS0R90cfqH9YozIg	Friendly prompt service.  Good food for a new and developing location.  Great if you are looking for a quick bite that is on par with the price point.
7jjt8pZbImIeg3zNRIPtaw	I had the Reuben.... Pretty delicious. I'll be coming back to try more of the dishes they offer. Fries are skinny and good as well.
lwWBBWGuVzyDkJqlkbJglw	Two words come to mind - overpriced and mediocre.  I went to MTO last weekend with a girlfriend, her son and my little brother. We arrived around 11, and the place was pretty packed. The menu was fairly limited, but I settled on the Hangover Burger and ordered the BLTAE for my little guy. I about choked when she told me my total.. I could have been served and paid much less. I guess they use better ingredients, but you really can't tell in the final product.  Our food came out promptly, and I was expecting greatness. The burger was smothered in some sort of sauce - maybe thousand island and iceberg lettuce. The whole entire time I was eating this concoction I was thinking of Smashburger's Sin City burger, which is about half the cost and 1000 times more tasty.   There is no reason to ever return. There are plenty of other options in DS. Skip this one!
P8BNvRTiMbn3hUHz49posA	Will be here once a week for breakfast... Going to try lunch and dinner later maybe 3 times a week type of place
V-sM3v-BQOwoZ608u6A9HQ	This place is awesome. Great outdoor seating, fast service, and the food is delicious. The chicken and waffles are one of the best in town.
M92hFJ-13wBiBFeMA48LPQ	Tried this place. Not my favorite. Food wasn't what I expected. Soup (Tomato Basil) was warm, not hot. It tasted a bit too tart. The grilled cheese was not melted. People were friendly. However, I don't think I will make a trip to go there again.
KEsbo9JPi9OQR1oEVKTTwQ	Back again second time this week trying out the black and bleu burger brought the mrs. Service fantastic as last time .. Greeted from the moment you walk in... The mrs loves it said the food I recommended (MTO breakfast) is great ... Awesome place
JBCx_IMqPzr3IF1NiLgdPQ	I have enjoyed 2 lunches here and  today I really enjoyed the avocado omelot and the pancakes that were amazing. The service is always excellent. Prices are a bit steep, but all the restaurants at Downtown Summerlin are. I feel that the food here is worth the price.
OW_jBQzJ1TAF89D5C9pSUg	Not impressed. It definitely was not worth what you pay for it. It wasn't  terrible, but the food and smoothies were bland. I feel like I could have gone somewhere a little cheaper and gotten the same or better meal. Underwhelmed and unsatisfied.
2uzFMiWeQ8KXwyU4Y2d4HQ	My son's grilled cheese was obscenely greasy, my turkey burger was fine but had none of the pickled jalapeno the menu said was included. Both of our fries were cold. The cashier was rude, rushed and asked 3 times if the "go go squeeze" on my son's stroller tray was from their restaurant. Sorry honey, but I have better things to do than steal an applesauce from your mediocre restaurant. The breakfasts looked huge and delish - maybe if we had chosen different food, I would be happier with my experience. But between the overpriced lunch, the rude cashier and the greasy grilled cheese, I'll probably pass on MTO next time. =(
CnBcznkL3-5ok8QD3RSmMw	New spot to try lunch was great new England clam chowder was amazing had the turkey melt and that was yummy also will come again to try more super yummy and great outside seating
NxF72_k07vyWL4An9O9Y4Q	Oh my gosh! I've died and gone to heaven! Chicken and waffles are the best! So glad it's a block from home! Never thought I'd see the day this mall and restaurants would be here!
ueeENn7LJjKIxI296woFog	I'm not entirely sure why this place has such good reviews. My girlfriend and I went here and ordered the seasonal berry waffles and the chicken and waffles. These were the blandest waffles I've ever had. The berries were fresh and the vanilla whip cream wasn't overly sweet which was a good thing. The chicken was cooked nicely but the gravy once again was entirely too bland. Why? If I'm paying 35$ for two orders of waffles they better be good. But what do you expect in downtown Summerlin I suppose. My next complaint is the staff. Between the 3 cashiers that all look as if they hate their job to the busser that sags his pants I'm not sure where to go from here. They have 8-9 staff members working for four tables, I'm also not sure how this business model is working for them but if they continue I'm sure they won't be in business for much longer. At least I hope not considering I don't want other people to also get ripped off. To the owner: Reevaluate.
gaCGhEYs3mTfp7Vu3Ohq6g	Loved the Tree Hugger quinoa patties and greens for brunch! Delicious and healthy! Very quick service too!
6QyC6qYvb3fmbwucLUcQUA	Great food...super expensive for a cafe! I will absolutely return in spite of the higher prices.
JXZcxxyfdMPamUYaKsuTBQ	Cool place.  The food is unique and really good.  I had lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry compote.  Yum!  The restaurant has bright colors and modern design...very clean.  I think it is overpriced, however, I will return for the pancakes.
24T7CwpMOlhjH29zGKf4Eg	I'm not one to complain about prices when the quality is in line with what is charged, however mto at Downtown Summerlin is outright ridiculous.  I went in for a smoothie and was amazed by a $9 price tag for a Creamsicle smoothie, but thought it must taste amazing for $9!!! It was terrible. Nothing but orange juice and vanilla soy.   Horrible and $9 down the drain. Staff seemed very young and inexperienced as well. Buyer beware!
XgXQTwnPDPN7eNdo4Pp3pw	It's just too overpriced for how below mediocre the quality is. Even if it was moderately priced it's still not good food in my opinion. I had a burger and would have preferred any of the basic burger places to it. It's got a good idea (business model wise) but I don't know why they think they can charge that much money for how bland their food is. I didn't like the downtown location either.
igQOZvf331hOjvVGRVS_Dg	Way too overpriced!! The food was...eh...good. I had the broccoli omelette. It was ok. It came with the omelette and about 4 sprigs of lettuce. Was that a generous side portion? The omelette was $11...come on, really? It was not that serious of an omelette to get away with charging that. My daughter had the kids pancake. It was loaded with chocolate chips, powdered sugar and a red mystery gel. It was good but not for what they charged. All in I spent $30. I don't mind paying for quality OR quantity but this place was clearly neither. The atmosphere was nice and staff was nice. I will definitely not be back nor do I recommend this place. There are better spots to get food from with better portions and quality.
p8u302iSj8y7mKTP2U1Mmg	Food is great but the service is amazing from the moment you get on the door a welcoming hello and smiling faces!!!
wQ_LHOLxOCwX6YnwD7k87A	Stopped in here on a busy Saturday afternoon and ordered the BLTAE. While the sandwich itself was delicious and the open faced presentation lovely, it was quite difficult to eat. It would have been much better had the sandwich not been served open faced. Putting the sandwich together was messy and because the plates have no rims/lips, the egg yolk leaked off the plate and onto the table.  My only other complaint would be to have more than one bathroom. With such a busy location, lining up to the bathroom was annoying.  No complaints on the food itself and although it is a little pricey the serving sizes are quite decent.  I would definitely come back and recommend this place to people.
YOLyYXuC04fHSKv3FnGFzw	So, my husband, daughter and I escaped out last Saturday evening for a quick bite to eat at Downtown Summerlin.  I had seen some great things about MTO Cafe on Yelp and through Instagram and suggested we give it a try as we were going for something quick and easy.  We each ordered a salad and split a side of fries(I know kind of an oxymoron, but this was concidered a cheat meal).  We decided to sit on the patio, as I always love the option to do so.  We made our way out and had a seat.  Not long after a gentleman with a very large dog seated himself behind us.  No qualms by us about the dog, but that's what initially drew my attention to the fact that we weren't lone soldiers on the patio.  We received our food, which was great(review not 100% on that).  It was from that point that I began to listen to the gentleman behind us begin to boss the friendly cashier around as to his demands of his order.  Then, something was not up to par on his order and he called for the manager on duty that evening.  He came out, also a seemingly nice young man, and he too got an earful from this guy.    Now, never at any time, would I say this guy was yelling; but I repeatedly kept mouthing to my husband how rude this guy was behind us.  When we got up to leave, I was so curious to know about this guy as at this point I thought he couldn't have just been some customer off the street; he had to have an affiliation.  So, I walked back inside to ask the initial friendly cashier; and come to find out, he was a partner in the restaurant!   Mr. Matt Moore, if you are reading this, it is one thing to ensure the food that is coming our of your kitchen is prepared well; I can appreciate that immensely, but it's another to demean your employees on your restaurant's patio, especially when there are customers within earshot.  I definitely see you have a lot of experience in the design and construction industry.  And, I also see you served for us; THANK YOU for that.  However, may I make a small recommendation:  Customer Service.  You built this business for a reason and are a part of it's face.  When you are part of its face, I would imagine you most certainly wouldn't want customers thinking that face is full of belittlement or superiority, but rather support and collaboration.  YOU are part of YOUR brand....
Ui0I_km59g59IyXIbD6ECg	Love the food here.  It's a bit pricey but you get what you pay for - high quality food with great flavor.  I took off a star because many of the soda choices were out of stock and the kids cheese burger was overcooked and the bun was hard.
Xq3UYnG4Pdnk9QqEZ7b7_Q	I stopped by this cafe for the first time this weekend for a good cup of coffee.   I had to stand on line that was out the door for a long time as there was only ONE person to take orders, work the ccash computer and serve people coffee and small items.   I got a small plain watered down cup of coffee from a hand pump caraf and was charged $3.25 for the bad coffee and bad experience.  Very disappointing and certainly no desire to ever return.
jiU0ulKXx3MtPzcwBuo01w	Food was ok but incredibly overpriced for a counter service restaurant. MTO breakfast was good. Lemon poppyseed pancakes were quite dry and had no lemon flavor.
N5Hb1VXNk9IhVVbApi5QRw	This place has the best clam chowder I've ever had in my life!!! Their BLT sandwich is awesome too (it's made with egg and avocado, you have to try it). Unfortunately their cookies are not up to par, but they have this amazing granola called "Rooster Boy" that's the best granola I've ever tasted.
RrwSCEIqiC6H8gK6es1Rrg	MTO was so incredible. We got the fat Elvis, chicken and waffle, wings, blue burger, and the Mac and cheese. The establishment is so cute it's like a order and sit down restaurant like a Panera bread style. The food is soooooo good and huge portions for the price. It was only 60$ for all of our amazing food. I will be back!!! The staff were very helpful and friendly.
x_U8n7mTVk1PTiotVatPxg	With the resturant having more than half of the tables empty,  a line out the door waiting to order....   You tell everyone you're not taking orders to catch up?  So basically you cant handle a crowd that fills only half of your capacity.   Cut your menu down or do a better time with staffing.   Waited at the front of the line for 15 minutes while you "caught up".  The staff just ignored everyone in line making us all wonder why we are just standing here.    The manager just say on his phone looking confused and nervous.   Finally got to order... was given the excuse that too many people ordered burgers so it cooled the grill down.   Food wasnt good enough to make up for the long wait and price that came along with it.
VvBz5OSLN3EEP6FSGrLP6g	Ordered a Broccoli and Avocado Skillet with a side order of Bacon and waited over 30minutes for our meal. Had to walk up to the counter to inquire about order twice and was told they had a computer glitch. Everyone else who ordered after me received their order and left the premise before we finally got our meal. I was very disappointed and would not eat there or recommend this establishment. A restaurant manager tried to remedy the situation with fried doughnuts but that didn't do the trick in my book! Meal Should've been refunded!
C1Gl5qfvN7mM_jhPoMetPg	If I could just say Hangover burger and have the completed review, I would do so, but for the integrity of Yelp, I will write something a little more detailed.  Dined here on a Saturday, during the opening of CREAM, and the cafe was PACKED. It was so packed that the restaurant had to close off the kitchen for an extended amount of time, but it was due to the swarms of people coming in and out.  People don't give the workers here much credit, but they deserve all the credit, They were all very friendly to me, and empathized, which is big in the hospitality industry.  My cousin had the chicken and waffle and we also ordered a side of the bacon dippers.  The location of the restaurant near the parking lots, and near the other restaurants was also a plus. Though I highly doubt anyone will be dining outside during the intense summer heat, the fact that they have an outdoor dining area is wonderful. Allows you to take in the fresh air, while you take in the fresh food coming out of the kitchen.  I enjoyed my time at the MTO Cafe, and I can't wait to dine here or at their Downtown location again.
550xhcFfFfpORT8Ph_YK8A	This place is great!! From the service to the food you can't go wrong!! The Hangover Burger was to die for. It was super juicy and the flavors were on point! The manager Chris made sure we were taken care of from the time we walked in to the time we left. I will definitely be coming back very soon!
6YkwGg5eji-O_vABYj3skw	Well well well... I'll have to start off by saying it sucks for MTO (or any business) to have to deal with getting 3 stars or less from people who do not know how restaurants work, oh and the ones who can't cook to save their own lives, oh and definitely the ones who all they know is Chili's and that $6.99 prime rib dinner at the Cannery!! Then they get on sites like Yelp and speak like they know what they are talking about... People! People! .... Stop wasting everyone's time by giving businesses 2 stars because it was too packed and you had to wait longer! What do you want these places to do, something is obviously going right if the place is packed! Or giving them 3 stars because the food was good, but they got your order wrong the first time and that pissed you off but you didn't say anything when that restaurant sends out a free dessert item! You people are annoying, lame, and disgruntled.  Anyway sorry I had to take away from MTO's positives!! The food was great. The atmosphere was great, the options of food were just right (I hate restaurants with a thousand items on it, you know everything on it can't be fresh), and definitely the service I really liked and received from the staff! Chris I believe was his name, but everyone was cool! That KFC dish was definitely permanently programmed on my taste buds!!  MTO needs to open something in the Mountains Edge, or Gramercy area!
FHn4yDstDnJwrelNKdAJ4A	Very dissappinted in service. My boyfriend and I are vegan and specifically came here because another vegan told us of their great experience. I saw that some items on the menu could be made vegan upon request. I ordered the tomato basil soup which came with a grilled cheese - all vegan. We also ordered a falafel sandwich. When the soup and grilled cheese arrived, the grilled cheese looked a little suspicious. I asked if it was vegan, and the woman said no, they don't have vegan cheese. They had no answer when we asked why a non-vegan side would come with a vegan item on the menu. Instead of rectifying their own mistake, we were offered two toothpicks with three small pieces of fruit. The manager said that's "the best" he could do.   We will not return and do not recommend this restaurant to anyone.
hm9T0vk1TNNk3YL0QUaecQ	This should have been covered in business 101 but when your recording says you're open till 9 stay open till 9! Drove down arrived at 8:25 to find out you close at 8 ... Won't be back
woYsajl8ZtHapwwKqJsQ-Q	I've been here twice already and have enjoyed both my meals very much! I've had the hen house wrap and it tasted very fresh, loved it. Today I tried the Chicken in a waffle, asked for it without the gravy and it was so delicious! I ate it so quickly!  The only reason I say a 4 rather than a 5 is because it's more on the pricey side, but it's reasonable =)
1gOhEBBzCLjm8VGs0Jwm-w	My fiancé and I moved to Vegas 2.5 months ago, and discovered MTO Café quickly upon our arrival. Nestled in the beautiful Downtown Summerlin, we were thrilled to find this delicious restaurant/take-out style café where you don't have to wait for table service, yet get to sit back and enjoy an awesome (comfort) meal.  My fiancé raves about the BLTAE (Bacon Lettuce Tomato Avocado Egg) Sandwich. It's a huge portion with a heaping side of fries and well worth it's price tag. That alone lures him back twice a month (at least).  I, myself, first indulged in the Strawberry and Spinach Salad with Gorgonzola and a Balsamic dressing. That was delicious. Next I tried the Turkey Melt, and melt in my mouth, it did. So many awesome flavors in one bite - I don't know how they do it. Everything from the dressings to the toasting of the bread is perfectly mouthwatering.   I've also tried The Bob, which was fantastic. Sometimes they include these roasted cherry tomatoes, which are difficult to chew, but taste fantastic.   As for the service, we are always always greeted with a super friendly clerk who takes the order, delivers the food, and clears the table. They are even friendly enough to make suggestions on the menu and wait patiently while I indecisively try to order. We've never gone at a time where there's a line or crowd, so I suppose dinner isn't their busiest hour. Nevertheless, we always leave stuffed and so satisfied at the delicious crafting of foods here.  Highly recommend!
xhw9RniQJl6HSKcBQ2OfYA	Would not reccomend. Overpriced avereage food coupled with a very strange ordering system and a return trip is not in the cards.  I had the Hangover Burger. Bacon an egg on a burger with sauce and fries. Generous portioon of fries. Good but not great. Others had soup and sandwich another had a wrap and another had a skillet. All said the same. Good not great. At 70 plus tip for four I expected more.  And the tip was another point of oddity and left me feeling that the ordering had not been completely thought out OR the place takes you for a sucker. See, when you go into MTO you order at a counter like fast food and pay when you order like fast food.  But the food is brought out to you like a restaurant and the girl came around to check on us like a restaurant. So end of meal time to tip based on food and service but we had already paid. I don't carry cash. No one with me did either. So we had to buy a drink to leave a top. Our only other option was to tip BEFORE we got our meal when we paid at ordering. That's not happening.  I was overruled when I suggested no tip but I bet the girls get stiffed quite a bit.  Not a satisfying experience. The food is not worth going back for. Good but not great and the price is wrong.
l0XaPQHgY588-jxiyT-9dg	Lemon poppyseed pancakes were good.  Kentucky fried chicken ok, pretty dry.  Salt and pepper fries yum. My son had the cheeseburger it was ok.  Overall good but I would like to give it another try since the menu is full of things that sound so good and hopefully it will be more impressive next time.
Tjnx4IlDkVQ4bgvVhiDQGw	Was hungry during lunch hours so why not brunch right? Passed this place numerous times located in Downtown Summerlin, me and wifey decided to go check it out. The minute me and wifey walked in we were greeted loudly "welcome to MTO Cafe!"  I waited impatiently in line for about 7 minutes before I could order which I think was a bit long, there were only two in front of me. I ordered the Turkey Melt along with their New England clam chowder, with a cup for water. I paid via their tablet system with a credit card, using my finger to sign. The cashier gave me a number to place on my table so they would know where to bring the food.   This place is unique in that other then the staff bringing your food you do all the work. From getting the utensils and napkins to even getting the condiments up front by the register. I honestly don't mind this approach as 1 it's less to worry about them screwing something up and 2 there is not spot to tip on the bill! Only a tip jar. They must pay their employees handsomely.   The ambience seemed busy as it was crowded but definitely welcoming with its random art and warm color tones. They even have USB ports by their seats in case you need to charge up. The Clam Chowder was awesome, had bacon bits in it, which they told me about beforehand. The turkey melt was equally amazing, although I feel they skimped on the cheese, also not to crazy about stringy fries but that's just a personal preference.   So aside from the wait, stringy fries, and lack of enough cheese in my sandwich I'd say for sure we'll be coming back again as my complaints aren't that dire.
CWunTsZM2F3LpxASlhwunA	I had the chicken skillet and the red juice! Both were delicious. I prefer the red juice over the green juice but both are good. The staff was very friendly.
KRP5uFXrPYvhU0OXqYVxUw	This was my first time here and staff was very friendly and very helpful telling us about the menu. We ordered breakfast. Everything tastes very fresh and well cooked. Big portions. I can't wait to go back again.
hRJU-ISjYfbziZitWeZ3DA	Second time to eat at this location and was not as happy as last visit. Prices are expensive for the amount of food you get and I think it's wrong for the machine to ask for a tip as you pay on the register before even getting food or service. It's self serve so basically why am I tipping, it's also tacky to leave a tip jar at the register when they only bring your food to your table as drinks and everything else is self serve. I don't see other restaurants asking for tips for the kitchen staff. Ordered the apple baked rings, while they tasted good I think it's ridiculous to pay $7 and only get 3 on a plate, very deceiving on the menu board. Will not return as I will continue to visit EAT downtown and other local restaurants there
TfKGN0-bjqrPm7AmxTq8gA	I'm a fan of MTO's Downtown location and the Downtown Summerlin spin off doesn't disappoint either. Their version of Kentucky fried chicken ($13) is similar in name only to the fast food spot with the same name. The chicken here has a thick, well seasoned crust that virtually cracks open. With two eggs over easy, mash browns, and country gravy, this is one of the better breakfast dishes around. Other breakfast dishes are well crafted, like the chorizo skillet and you can't go wrong with the bacon dippers --strips of bacon covered in pancake batter.  The juicy patty and the salty and sharp blue cheese in the black and bleu burger ($13) make a for a great combo. But, you'll need plenty of napkins while eating it. Save some of those napkins for the chicken in a waffle ($13) too. Covered in country gravy along with maple syrup it can be messy but delicious. Their version of chicken pot pie ($15) uses biscuits instead of a typical pastry crust topping, but flavors come through, just the same. It's creamy and packed with pulled chicken, although it could have benefitted from more vegetables.  They've also got a kid's menu with chicken fingers, waffles, and grilled cheese sandwiches. For fast-casual comfort food with a modern twist, they've got all the bases covered for the whole family any time of day.
5bo8Osaq5Ly32wCnOW4W3w	I prefer their other location but still delicious healthy food. I have never had something I didn't like here. I enjoy the honey walnut sandwich but my sisters breakfast plate was also delicious! Nice area to walk around after and have some ice cream and shop. This was a side of Vegas I had not explored previously and I enjoyed how local it felt.
XOkZ6TI0UtbxrE4cVgg9TA	Have been to MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin a few times now.   Sometimes it was good (the clam chowder) and sometimes not so much. About one week ago I decided to try the Chicken Pot Pie as it's one of their signature dishes and I had seen the reviews on Yelp.   This dish was a deal breaker in that I won't be returning to this place ever again.   Presentation is cute, comes in a little skillet with biscuits. The chicken was flavorless and tough. I had to add a ton of salt just to have some sort of seasoning. The biscuits were so hard I had to use a knife to cut through them (think hockey puck) and then the taste was like cardboard (think cardboard). As I'm trying to navigate some flavor out of this dish, I happen upon a chicken bone, and I mean a large bone.   The waitress comes over, asks how the meal is, so I point to the bone and tell her (nicely) I don't think I would order this again and give her the particulars as stated earlier. She was nice and apologetic but nothing more. No manager was asked to come, she just trotted off like, "oh well, thanks for coming in", and left me.   So here I am staring down at my chicken bone, served with dried out hockey puck biscuits covering a tasteless goo of tough chicken and wondering, why I was paying $15 for this meal?  There are waaay to many options in this town to get great food so I'll be checking MTO off my list as one.
UURm4eEy4yF2-J71efCDiQ	Place was super clean and inviting but prices were way too much for their servings. My family had the breakfast and my omelet was nicely seasoned but small, small salad on side with no dressing for over $11.00? BabyStacks cafe blows away their breakfast food menu and pricing for the amount of serving.
ebvwyZxV4IXbl7IWArPGVg	We had the bacon pancake dippers and mac and cheese. Food was really good. Atmosphere is cozy. All employees were super friendly. Great place for comfort food!
2M1d9napH74sFxcQ0KXtxQ	I have been going to there location in downtown Las Vegas, and was really excited to hear they opened up in downtown summerlin. Food is always on point along with service!
aAMDgymBEEJQ2u-Wd5BFxQ	I've only had a few items here and they've all been really good. Only reason for not giving it 5 stars is that I don't think I've had enough of the menu to say everything is great. Have been with a few friends and they got lunch items and said it was good but nothing spectacular.   I like the outdoor seating by the fountain too. Good ambience on a late morning weekend.
teXUIhab-g-yXl_mPqJCqw	Best place to go to when you want that breakfast in my pictures I'm showing the MTO breakfast and my 1st time trying chicken and waffles ... 1st bite is unbelievable ... Young Lee is the man!
GCdapyol6u4wIIhy5GN_rQ	This is a good place for a lunch or late breakfast before a day of shopping. I really like their chicken skillet with egg whites. It's pretty healthy and really flavorful. The service is always friendly when they take your order and the food comes out pretty quickly even when they're busy.
GHH10-YIIGJN5LITMdb7rw	Fantastic for lunch or snacks. Varied menu with interesting flavors and colorful presentation. Staff are extremely friendly without being annoying. The entire place is very well managed. Service is prompt. Food is served fresh from the kitchen so expect hot food to be hot and fresh. Highly recommended.
TEFnuo2-dk6ZA7V1jx098Q	This was my first visit with my girlfriend to a restaurant here in at the mall. We're giving all of the restaurants in the new mall a try, and so far by far this Café is #1 by far compared to my previous dining. This guy in a zebra shirt recommended the chicken in a waffle and their hangover burger. Both were fantastic. Later he came back and talked to us and we found out the nice guy was a manager....I'm coming back for that zebra shirt btw haha. He was very friendly, the register girl was very friendly, and the atmosphere was friendly. Will definitely try again after my tour of the mall.
dJPduUQTSbxONMIpIqeyZg	This review is for their Cappuccinos and Lattes  The staff was friendly and the service was great, but their espresso drinks were extremely watered-down!!!!
jGb44BiRmE5RHik18WMfEg	Great little place to grab a quick bite! Very fresh and customer service is great!!  Prices a little steep for  portions, definitely would be back..
zRZPN3sFhU0Bsyu9xJytJA	Price is steep for the give service. Food was ok, we ordered two of the MTO's breakfast which seed like spam and eggs. Not too happy with the service
wZT9Zg_7H58DjiJmAubNbQ	Definitely overpriced for what you get! I had gotten the hangover burger to go for my daughter before and my two bites of it were great so we returned to try it again as well as other things. Also, I had read an interview with some local chef who raved about the lemon poppyseed pancakes with blueberry ginger compote. As another reviewer noted, the pancakes were super dry and devoid of any flavor and there was no discernible ginger flavor in the compote. Very disappointing. My daughter's tomato basil soup was just so so, bit too thick for my taste, and I didn't bother tasting her grilled cheese. The hangover burger was just ok, nothing special. The patty has some good beefy flavor but other than not, not worth the price tag. I never mind paying for great taste and quality, but don't like getting gouged for mediocre food. I will not be returning....
cf_7twCfULpY5m5h2M7w9w	If you're looking for awesome food and a fun relaxing environment, this is the place to be. The employees here are amazing! Shelby, Trevor, & Amber shine way above the rest, they are the reason me and my wife keep coming back, aside from the amazing food that is. Keep up the great work guys!
QEo0Ibh40BSPriSNfypRiw	Went in for lunch today with my family. I'm not opposed to the fast casual concept but this place was priced for full service. I had a simple grilled cheese sandwich (can't eat Brie so I ordered the kids version). My daughter had the kids pancake. $7 for ONE pancake with no sides. Husband had a sandwich and we all had fountain drinks and our bill was $36. We could've eaten somewhere much nicer for that price. Food was mediocre at best. We won't be back.
3ETuS8arBhlyynYy_er0xg	Christine is very pleasant and kind! She was super friendly and patient as my mom and I were trying to decide what to get. The other employees are also very pleasant and courteous. The food was fresh and flavorful. I love that they use organic chicken. Definitely a bonus. Great atmosphere and great location!
qb0Ml79K-mV6roSP78k3KA	We visited this location since we know the MTO brand from our visits to the downtown location. When I walked in to this MTO I felt lost I felt like it wasn't MTO which completely defeated the purpose of me going to visit a brand I already know.
C3ktAunrWCbKN4VOXtpBXw	This was an expensive 18.00 sandwich, and it fell apart.  Was mushy as well.  Parking in Downtown Summerlin was a disaster.
-R58l_-wjf-JcNVFv9O8cQ	THE BOB organic chicken, arugula, roasted tomatoes, jack & cheddar, pecan honey mustard on wheat + fries  Everyone should basically just get that and thank me later. The fries are really good.   Service is friendly. Prices are fair. A great casual restaurant in summerlin and it is much better than other similar concepts nearby, IMO
qzhXOgELh2E3NJvrH8s1OQ	I enjoyed food and place a lot , love the menu, tried chicken and waffle ,was delicious I will came back for sure
6zhMfYiPQ0jxw6jcWe_-bQ	Love MTO. Friendly staff, and several delicious options to choose from. Good for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Be sure to check it out if you're around Downtown Summerlin.
VtgFtuA5RRq8mVOlfjkdQw	Having been to the original location Downtown I was relatively confident that I would enjoy this location as well, I we wrong. We came here for breakfast today, my mom ordered the Kentucky fried chicken and eggs and I ordered the tri tip and eggs with toasted brioche.   The food took longer than expected to come out and it was with disappointment that I note how little I enjoyed just about everything I tried. The brioche was barely toasted and somewhat cold, the eggs were a soggy mess as were the hash browns and the tri tip was absolutely flavorless. I was forced to douse my entire plate with salt, pepper and chili sauce to give it any sort of flavor whatsoever. My mom's chicken was just as disappointing. The only thing about our meal that I enjoyed was the iced tea which was brewed well and strong.  I have no interest in returning to this location again.
OSjtAlEC92GdUxaAj7INLQ	Food was just okay (big portions though). My food came out 20 minutes before my husbands which was lame. Also, we both used $5 off coupons we had received from a friend and come to find out after we left they had only taken $1 off my husbands bill and $3 off of mine. That is unacceptable and sneaky.
guwEyNi8gUBiiLkL8krrzw	Definitely a fan of MTO Cafe at Downtown Summerlin! My husband and I stopped in for brunch today for the first time. I really liked it - I thought the food was delicious and I really like that it's walk up rather than table service. It's nice if you're not feeling like cooking breakfast at home, but you also don't want to wait for service all morning on a busy Sunday at a restaurant.   We ordered the waffle with seasonal berries and vanilla whipped cream. The waffle was perfect, with fresh strawberries and blueberries, and I loved their house-made whipped cream! My husband had the tri-tip with eggs and their "hash mash", which is hash browns with mashed potatoes in the middle, and yes, it's absolutely as delicious as it sounds. He thought it was good but thought the portion was small for the price. I sneaked a few bites and thought it was super tasty! Apparently they used to use a dry espresso rub for the tri-tip but they don't anymore - kind of a bummer, would have loved to try that! Last note, the coffee was good which always makes or breaks a good spot for me. We had a good experience here this morning and will definitely be back!  Tip: when you pay for your meal, have your receipt sent to your phone. I think it's every five times you pay, you get a coupon for 50% off your next meal. Love that!
NY774ewcCDqNc0HeV0QwDQ	Located in the heart of Summerlin, mto Cafe wasn't quite what I expected. This restaurant is a blend of "do-it-yourself" dining, some healthy juices, basic wraps and omelettes and table-side cleanup. You have to get your own silverware, salt and pepper, napkins and beverages which are dispensed from something you might have imagined seeing on the Jetson's. The food was ok. Not bad but nothing to rave about. If you want a full service meal, mto Cafe is not your best choice. But the food was ok and the price was reasonable.
h9yNTa_yB2H9L6Ge7JFdyQ	I was very happy to meet some of your staff this past Tuesday at the Shelby Museum event! The burger with the Quail egg was AWESOME! We live right up the street and plan on visiting your Downtown Summerlin location very soon.
z6AyVdncGB3VnEIjEHBJCA	Why the HELL did I not come here sooner??? DAMN..sustainable organic whatever,man..it's still DAMN good!! Amber took the time to explain the menu, sign ups,etc and Allison and Trevor were a delight..I got the Vegan falafel and my daughter got chicken and waffles and all I can say is HELLA GOOD!! And they're playing kick ass music...all kinds of peeps here. ..I'm digging on this place..
DuxpXlD8M1PHZur0JBEneA	-Fresh high quality ingredients -friendly staff -clean and spacious  -pumping out the food real fast
TTHTn2m6nTqqGu9dOzH28A	Very rarely do I give 5 stars, I'm pretty picky. This place rocks! It's clean, the chairs are so comfy and the customer service is outstanding. Now to the food, I ordered a Kentucky Fried Chicken breakfast and it was delicious. Boyfriend got a berry waffle that he loved. At first I thought the prices were a little high, but totally worth it. Quality and taste is perfect. Can't wait to come back and try another dish.
tkFnMUCvGyBoSTIP55PWNw	I went here over a week ago.  I am still dreaming about my return to have the Hangover Burger once again.   It is TDF.  This is a two handed burger that is indulgently mess...juices running down your arm, about a dozen napkins needed. The egg was perfectly cooked...oozy warm yolk, medium burger cooked medium (yeah!), good sturdy but soft bun (which I don't eat, but gives structure), I believe quality Tillamook Cheddar for a little tang and more unchousness? (sp).    Just me...I wish service wasn't so cafeteria like but they still bring it too you!  Great place...I will return!
2Tqr8DMKW8M8WccPVtT7HQ	After sampling a Hangover Burger at the Redline Rendezvous YEE, I looked forward to going to the new MTO Cafe to try more of its offerings at the source.  So, Diane and I met another couple there to do just that.  At first I was put off a bit by the spartan interior, lack of any other customers at the time, and that there was no waiter service.  For some reason, I had it in my head that the MTO Cafe would be much like the Sahara's old bustling full-service Nascar Cafe, and be a haven for comfort food.  I was right on the second supposition, but in error on the first.  And, I was slightly embarrassed that I had recommended such a casual, seemingly fast food eatery as a place to sit down to dinner with friends.  But once the food arrived, and I gazed at and initially tasted my BLTAE, my concerns were quickly dispelled.  My friends were pleased with their food: a Black & Blue Burger with French Fries, and a Grilled Cheese Sandwich with Tomato Soup, as was I.  Only Diane lamented that her Hangover Burger was not medium rare as requested.  Yet this place is decidedly not a fast food joint.  Some very good creative cooking occurs here.  I had almost instructed the order taker to hold the egg, but thought it would be more sporting and adventurous to try a BLTAE just as is was intended to be served.  This turned out to be a wise decision, for the oozing egg yolks from two quite large and perfectly prepared Sunnyside Up Fried Eggs lubricated and added flavor to the large sammie, which I had to figure out how best to eat.  I was initially torn between cutting through one-half of the heaping and rather messy sandwich with a knife and then eating it with a fork or wrestling with it by hand, before just picking it up with one hand the normal way and directing it at my mouth.  But to get my mouth around this imposing specimen on a plate took some doing.  Yet after opening my mouth like a gaping upraised garage door, sliding the loaded and egg yolk-drenched bread slices inside, and then chomping down on the strips of crispy bacon, I was in comfort food heaven, and knew that this sandwich could be eaten in the conventional manner.  Slices of red tomatoes and shards of lettuce, large chunks of very fresh avocado, and a generous heaping of excellent crisp matchstick Fries added to the enjoyment of my meal, along with a multi-variety Coke dispenser with unlimited refills.   In rating a restaurant, In my book the quality and taste of food are of paramount importance.  And, although the ambiance here was somewhat stark and resembled a school cafeteria, the place was clean, and restaurant staffers were friendly, helpful, and accommodating.  I expect to be back!
E84Xez0qNCAszR1jCs9vrQ	I've ate at both locations now, the downtown & downtown summerlin location.. Food is great.. a little overpriced for the portions, but so yummy.. I tried the fat elvis & also the bacon pancake dippers.. soo good.. :P
YhN_gN7_PMyRTc-wmVH6Tw	Interesting place for Breakfast in Downtown Summerlin this past Sunday (Nov 8)! More of a Fast Food process for ordering, then they give you table a number and deliver the food to you. Drinks were self-served   I had the Triple Stack and John had the MTO Breakfast. The food was Very Good.. Eggs were cooked as we ordered. The portions are huge so 2 people could actually share one meal. We took a to go box that was pretty full home. It was pretty busy and the service was very good. I would definitely go again!
SKgJBx0Cqm7HVNPOctsokQ	Decided to try somewhere new on my day off while walking around Downtown Summerlin. MTO cafe was perfect! Fun, friendly atmosphere.  Food was fresh and cooked to order. I had the Avocado Egg Skillet which is a scramble of eggs, red onion, jalapeño jack cheese & tomatillo sauce, topped with fresh avocado. It's what's under the scramble that makes it so yummy....a nest of their signature potatoes.  They are thinly sliced shoestring type and cooked to perfection! It's all served in a hot cast iron skillet so the dish stays warm while you are enjoying it! Nothing worse to me than cold scrambled eggs. My meal was at noon and I love that I could order eggs.... Because sometimes A girl just wants breakfast for lunch!  I'll be back to try out the rest of the menu!
BJJgjnMz2cynXyDndtW8OA	We've been in twice now for lunch. This place is nice! It's got a neat patio and we've had nice service on both occasions.   The food is very good. The Mac and cheese stood out and we were pleased with our salads. We had one complaint on our last visit and were told the item was changing so it was in transition. I hope they continue to evolve!   I would certainly go back for a casual and tasty lunch al fresco.
pQKLchqFcD2RfoTH2l4xmw	Don't try to order off the kids menu unless you can prove you have a child with you. I wanted plain chicken fingers and they don't offer it on the regular menu. Also, I wasn't feeling well enough for a full meal of something else. They wouldn't let me get chicken fingers. Clearly they don't understand that some adults have health issues and can only eat certain foods and/or smaller portions. My husband ordered a burger and a drink. Totaled $17. I really don't think my $7 overpriced, kids chicken fingers should have been a big deal. I am now waiting for Blue Ribbon to open at 11am so I can go get some chicken fingers. I'm sure they will be glad to take my $7+. At many restaurants, I often order from the kids menu when I am not feeling well. NEVER have I been denied food. I always make sure to order a drink and my husband gets a full priced meal to make up the difference. This place just has bad customer service and I won't be back. It's really unfortunate, because I have enjoyed their food in the past. Oh well. Time for some Blue Ribbon !
qbuqt-3ESJM43hhv64oDfw	Don't get this 3 star review twisted. I really like this place. The food is very tasty, the staff is always friendly and this location has a cute outdoor patio. I would give this place a solid 4 stars if it wasn't for the prices.   Now I'm not one to complain about the cost of stuff. If it's good, I will justify it. But keep in mind this is a quick service place. Order at the counter, get your own soda and they bring your food out to you. So when I see $7 for a cup of tomato soup, Nope, that's where I draw my line.   My spinach salad was so awesome but without chicken ($3 extra) it would have been a little boring simply because it would have only been 3 ingredients- spinach, quinoa and tomatoes. My honey got the tri-tip breakfast plate and the meat was rare (not even warm it was cooked so quick). So we brought it back up and the quickly fixed it but the flavor was just very beefy (not in a good way). The rest of the plate was delicious but he wouldn't order it again. Said he'd go back to the protein plate instead.   Overall, yummy and quick but it hits your pocket just a little too hard. Which makes MTO more of an occasional lunch stop instead of a regular one.
Rll1fU4njEA4zMBCxaRYAw	Ugh, I want to love you! I had good experience at the MTO downtown but as pretty as this place is, it failed so bad on just my coffee. Which is sacred to me. It was cold and windy and there MTO was in all its orange glory. I walked in, was greeted with great smiles and ordered a simple latte. Like I said, I dined at the MTO downtown so I was ready to enjoy this coffee when it tasted like steamed milk. I popped to the top off to see what it looked like steamed milk with a splash espresso. The color was so wrong and so was the purchase. I brought it back to have one remade and again, although slightly better - it wasn't what it should be. So anyway....
32kA6noKO73_ZHPvptiIjQ	I was WOWed by the food here.  I had the daily special 'Black Chicken', simple dish but it was incredible, cooked perfectly and full of flavor.  If I was in the right mood I would have gotten the 'Fat Elvis'!  Definitely a place for Breakfast/Brunch.  Highly recommended.
vQthILT23jCu3Hy6AByO5Q	The hen house wrap with smash Browns instead of fries is all I need from this place.  Bomb.
CEtBu1At2n6fKSX2gIj6EA	I haven't put a bite of food in my mouth yet but I rated this restaurant one star just because the cashier he took our order LITERALLY rolled her eyes the entire time my kids and I gave her our order. First and last time I eat here.
N9cWWQXIEiA1kMSSSPrSrQ	This has been my go to  burger spot whenever I'm on the summerlin side of town. The burgers are juicy, flavorful, and I'm never disappointed. It always feels like you are given a never ending amount of fries(which is awesome!) The cashier people are always nice and ready to get your order.  4/5 because there have been times where the fries felt hard like rocks.
sEzOa3am0vEbjPH0oXom8g	Their food is amazing !!!!! I got the French toast & my boyfriend got the Kentucky fried chicken. Both were so good. This might be our new fave breakfast spot now :) & the atmosphere is so mellow & calm & the staff seemed pretty nice & we didn't have to wait too long for our food , we are here on a Sunday & it's not even packed which is more than perfect !
wgXvg9MCteb54GTBYf4Zaw	If I could leave 0 stars I would. This is the third time they have either totally forgotten my order or gotten it wrong. I waited 25 minutes for my order only to be told they must have lost it and hadn't even started it. And I barely even got an apology or a refund for an order that did t exist. Go anywhere else.
0Rlu-Qhryc2TRTfEq81q6A	This is one of those places where you can get food and feel healthy about it.  Typically these kind of places aren't cheap.    I got the smoked salmon skillet and was disappointed.  The salmon was red and super salty.  I like salty, but I felt like I was just eating salt.  Comes with cream cheese, dill, eggs, and hash browns.  I like my salmon orange and marbleized, so I'm not sure why this salmon is red.  Was it some sort of dye to preserve the salmon to keep it fresh?    Maybe I'll give MTO another shot and try something else, but the smoked salmon...never again.
n0W5SdUqT6HTDy9I3sjVDw	It's been a very long time since I've had food that just doesn't do anything for me. There is no shtick, no wow, no pizzazz. Well, maybe the uncomfortable aftertaste that lingered longer than I'd like to admit. The service was ho-hum, not bad, not good or great. I guess you could say that there approach is food is fuel, not fun or enjoyable. I guess you could say the options in Vegas have left me jaded and this isn't going to hold up to the competition.
Gg7XV54JaV-6X_vMHDen8g	This is our go-to place. Everything we've had has been excellent. From the hangover burger, to chicken and waffles, to fat elvis, to falafel wrap.   Quiet, clean and nice. Our favorite.
dnFW7aguEiqIHKwrLoYeBQ	We are here at least twice a week. Kid friendly and all the girls are super nice and patient with my little one (and his never ending requests for more orange slices). Have never had a bad experience and hope it stays that way. Food comes out fast and always as we ordered it. Favorites include the avocado skillet and the falafel wrap. Always steady but quiet. This is my go-to for a quick weekday dinner when I'm not in the mood to cook! Hope you guys are here forever!
YRoTu3z1PIua7w6NzsVbeQ	To make a long review short, this place is fantastic. The food, portions, and quality are all reasonable for the price. The avocado skillet, the vegan pancakes, and the BLTAE are out of this world. Oh, and another great thing about this place is their customer service. All of the employees are such a charm. Amber, Allyson and Lilly are really attentive. Their customer service blows my mind.  On a different note, one thing that I did notice was that a couple of people bitch about MTO not offering wifi... If you're looking to use wifi go to Starbucks, if you are looking to have a good meal go to MTO.
IcrE_Sf-LIhjn_BksoWyfw	I had the Chorizo skillet and my wife had the Teriyaki Turkey Burger on a lettuce wrap. Food was flavorful but was lukewarm. Mine wasn't cooked in the skillet that it was served in. Good place, good ambience, just would request that the food be served hotter.
514H7nMZhD2K1a7mwIKCxA	Went here for breakfast for the first time today with my family and It was absolutely the best. Everything was fresh and hot. Pancakes to die for. The atmosphere was so nice. I highly recommend this lovely place.
B6P04-iza2GdCjGSkyzg2g	On Feb 15. My husband and I went to MTO Cafe and ordered a pastry and a latte. 10 minutes later our pastry was brought to us hard and cooling because some parts were warm which told me it had been sitting too long. After seeing 7 other customers who came after us get their latter's over 20 minutes of waiting the guy brought my husband his latte. Don't get me wrong, the gentleman was very polite and the order taker was a sweet lady but the organization is as different as night and day between morning and afternoon. We've been to MTO Cafe a dozen times in the morning and the service has been friendly, organized, and fast. The 2 times we have gone around 4pm has been a perfect "How Not To Run A Restaurant Cafe/Kitchen" play book. Oh and incase you think I'm lying, my TICKET #25 @ 4:54pm.
1OXuKYmM7-eQcqpI5VvGGg	Service is great and they have healthy choices as well as not so healthy choices, my wife loves the tree hugger plate and I like the skillets
_MIfGf3uDBPekHYZ75Lwpg	This is one of my favorite breakfast places!  The Chicken in a Waffle, and the Kentucky Fried Chicken!  Always so good, fresh, and worth the drive from south Vegas!  We come every week! S/O to Amber - she's always super friendly, and has great customer service :)
kwTFNrAF_9IXaR0UXp2XfQ	I came here for an afternoon snack while strolling summerlin. It's a clean cafè, however, doesn't give any impression from the outside. But as they always say, "don't judge the book by its cover". That's what I did and nothing did change.  I ordered a chicken falafel. The falafel itself is pretty big and could be shared. However, it tasted nothing special. Sad to say, it's too commercialized. I ordered some fries too, which is pretty crispy and good.....You can't go wrong with fries anyway!!  I believe they have a special drink every now and then. I'm not quite sure how often they change or have that. But that day, I had Mango Lemonade, which is sweet and refreshing. However, it also tasted like as if it came from just the concentrates.   Price is not so bad. I wouldn't come here if you can still wait to find a better place to eat and explore.
FNBv1YowxhTLyW4AEllvGA	Love this place! I find myself craving it all the time after trying their Turkey Melt (with their house salad as a substitute for fries) and their Body Builder skillet! Both are fantastic and a must try! Wish they closed later since their menu could definitely be great for dinner - who says you can't have breakfast/brunch food for dinner?! Haha definitely try MTO when you are at DTS! :)
pdvChQiCz7OmWWlBbzEcaw	This is a great place to eat for breakfast, lunch or dinner while shopping at DT Summerlin. Their menu has great variety, and they are incredibly consistent with the quality.  Amber at the front is always super nice, and Chris one of the managers is really attentive every time I have ever asked for anything.   My favorite healthy option is the Tree Hugger, with a secret hack to add chicken. The Tree Hugger is a quinoa patty sandwich with a great spicy aioli. The added chicken completes the meal, as I always want a protein.  If you're feeling healthy schmealthy, the chicken and waffles is a MUST try.  Overall, lots of options, good food and really friendly staff.
lDBqZ0457CAVDx0BwUmsIQ	The turkey melt and the avocado skillet are my favorites here. The wait is a little long even when it seems no one else is there eating, but the food is always fresh and filling. A little expensive, but worth it in a pinch. Staff members are always wiping down tables and offering to take empty plates, and always greet me when I walk in the door. They have one of those cool Coke machines where you pick exactly what you want, too. Added bonus because I love me some Cherry Vanilla Coke.
NBqMNqk6TJn_GK7bNH-dSw	Chicken in a Waffle ($13): Country gravy and fries. Great waffles and delicious fried chicken strips.  Hen House ($11): Wrap w/ lettuce, organic chicken, roasted tomato, avocado, Caesar dressing, tomato-basil tortilla, and fries.  The Bob ($12): Sandwich w/ organic chicken, arugula, roasted tomato, jack and cheddar, pecan honey mustard, grilled wheat bread, and fries.  Everything I've had is delicious and hearty without being heavy. The ingredients are fresh and the portions are perfect. It's good food that isn't too healthy (love my fries!) for an easy and fulfilling lunch. When the weather is nice, the patio is beautiful to dine.
jScv-7XkpRqOhJgDZ6EDrw	After walking in,  you go to the counter to place your order. They serve breakfast all day. For lunch there are salads, sandwiches,  wraps and more. Also a small kids menu that is reasonably priced. We shared the $13 Reuben. It came with a choice of fries or a small salad. My grandchildren shared a grilled cheese sandwich off the kids menu. We chose to have it served with apple slices ( there were five very tiny apple slices - even for a kids menu side dish, this was a small portion) Ambience: it is set up as a fast food Eatery. Very Spartan in the decorating with maybe a dozen tables for 4 and chairs surrounding them. There is very loud music blaring. And with decent size crowd, the noise level is very very loud. They serve the food on real China, a very nice touch considering how informal the restaurant is. Service: the staff we're all very pleasant and seem to be genuinely happy working there. The food was brought out in the appropriate amount of time. A staff member came and cleared the table when we were done eating. Food: the Reuben sandwich was fairly light on the corned beef. I know that there was melted Swiss cheese in the sandwich because I saw it. However there was so little that you could not taste it. There was ample sauerkraut relative to the amount of meat. However , it was put on in such a way that it soaked the bottom piece of bread. Overall, a very disappointing Reuben sandwich. Especially at that price point. The kids got grilled cheese. I got to taste their leftovers. That was actually quite good for a kids grilled cheese sandwich (only $5 - quite reasonable).  Value: for a very informal fast food breakfast and lunch eatery , it was okay. However I feel that he was somewhat pricey for what you get. I won't be going back.
DKRnvdP_GtPhZMdimG9WwA	Great place to eat ! I love their healthy yet comforting menu and I go their atleast 3 times a month! Last time I was there I found a hair in my ketchup and I kindly took it back and and asked for a new one ! I think the hair was from the servers not the cooks.
kjt1VjgN9SIUf6qA5XJTsg	Was in Vegas for a whole week, best place to have brunch around. I have done buffets, top end places and  places like these. Wait staff is great, food is great, and the music was on point. I wished they had a location in my home town. For all you brunch couples out there. This place is a must. Easy to park , great for a mid day meal.
v870w24WkkuTgtPWOf0Wcg	Been wanting to try this place for a while. It reminds me of Rachel's Kitchen. It is a little bit expensive, but if a little money isn't an issue, then the food itself can hold up against a little scrutiny. The ingredients seemed fresh enough and the taste was good. I would go back again since it feels a bit healthier and quicker than some of the other options around.  Service was quite good and they came out to check on us often.
aeKYWLShv4NOBrdtJGS65Q	Nice spring lunch was enjoyed here today. Spring in Vegas means wind and this afternoon it was whipping so much patio dining was out of the question. Boo!  After browsing the menu trying to decide on breakfast or lunch items, I decided on that would satisfy both cravings. The BLTAE won the battle.  Thick grilled white bread served open face and slathered with mayo and topped with shredded iceberg, Roma tomatos, thick cut Applewood bacon and two perfectly cooked Sunnyside up eggs.  This item is located in the sandwich section but this job requires a knife a fork. Great menu item and very satisfying.  Shoestring fries served on side were also very good.  If I would change one thing about this dish it would be the lettuce. Maybe serve with piece of iceberg or step up to romaine or spring mix. Either would work.  We also had the Lemon Poppy seed pancakes with ginger blueberry compote. Yumm!.  I loved the tartness of the lemon throughout the pancakes. Balanced out by the sweetness of the blueberry topping. Another great dish.   Overall good visit. Next time we hope to enjoy the patio.
GZep-OkLGJUWpfkamLcAzA	I enjoy having breakfast here once in a while. They have plenty of healthy options. I usually go for the vegan pancakes with carrots, pecans, and agave syrup, along with the veggie hash with egg whites. The veggie hash is served in a skillet. Both are excellent. I also like the MTO break feast with egg whites, chicken sausage, turkey bacon, potatoes, and whole wheat toast. You definitely won't be disappointed with your meal.  The only complaint I have is the patio tables. I would enjoy dining on the patio, but most of the tables are wobbly and ready to topple over as soon as you place something on them. I am shocked that the manager would allow customers to sit at those tables. That issue needs to be addressed a.s.a.p.
zjCPZkpRtYUhLa-M82x4ng	I heard so much good stuff about MTO's downtown location. I don't know how this location compares, but I'm thinking that downtown must be better. The food is mediocre I ordered a Ceaser salad today the croutons were bomb the dressing had the consistency and taste of Helmans mayo, and it seems they used a low grade parmesian cheese.   The atmosphere is great and I like thy E outdoor area music inside could be turned down a bit. Probably won't come back too many other new places to explore here in DT.
VpCrsONW9hrIY3ylnHe_-g	Food is great, for a pretty good price! Not the best brunch in Las Vegas, but definitely one of the best if you're not looking to be downtown and deal with busy crowds. All staff including the manager was extremely friendly! The great vibe and energy alone are what keeps me going back!
AoqR3cFIQo2rtNWrfdra3Q	Food is delicious!!! Their menu is awesome and the service is wonderful!!! Their cronut burger is amazing!!! And they give large portions! Mac n cheese is to die for!!! We'll definitely be back!!!
pjUbmObPjw8JV9mKgGDd4A	Food"s so fresh and fabulous! Great casual place to eat with the friendliest staff! Kelly is awesome! Coming back with my dog next time!
bgy-SCA1HIkeoXHZGtaYwQ	MTO Cafe never disappoints! One of my favorite dishes has to be the KFC. Can't go wrong with county gravy, chicken and eggs!  What always has me coming back is the service. I'm always greeted with smiles as soon as I walk in. One of the servers Alison is always there to make sure all my needs are catered to!
DsAqerveRJUSv919hsSRxA	Lovely atmosphere.. :) As soon as my boyfriend and I walked in we were warmly greeted by these sweet and cute young ladies.. Helpful and considerate throughout our stay, superb work ethic.  My French toast was incredible. My guy loved his over easy eggs.. made just right. Great cook(s)! An absolute mouth watering breakfast.. Lovely staff and sweet tunes by Jack Johnson. Perfect Saturday morning! Thank you MTO Café, keep it up!
fOEyZOmAfGRphc4EULnkGA	MTO is amazing! We were warmly greeted as soon as we walked in and the pretty redhead cashier, Noelle, didn't rush us while we took a few minutes to look at the huge menu. She suggested the chicken and quinoa salad which was so good! She even checked on us while we were eating to make sure we liked everything, and brought us our silverware when we forgot to grab some after ordering. I can't wait to go back there again!
C7BOJxbsCsmtDsmQ8C04vQ	Great service loved the turkey melt! Lacie and Hanna helped me out and were very friendly. Went to cream after, love the location and the atmosphere inside the restaurant!
FzWXPr4bq3OIEkaLIb3Viw	Definitely my new go-to brunch spot and a hidden gem in Downtown Summerlin. Everyone there is so sweet and smiling. Alyson recommended me the avocado skillet and it was amazing! Love the mash browns that go with it. I would recommend going on a weekday since they get pretty busy on the weekends. Either way, great service and delicious food!
zb62UzIsK-5z1yPl9AlrHg	I had the steak and eggs.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the steak was cooked medium rare like I ordered.  All the staff was great giving energy to the restaurant.   The only drawback is that they  did not have a steak knife to cut the steak.   Other than that  everything was fantastic.
KD4uKFAPkdVGOtUAwjWKww	Very disappointed in my $14 hamburger that I waited 30m for. Staff seems put out. Food was average. Tables outside weren't cleaned promptly so birds were flocking. Won't be back.
HqybSYkOoAwr54xtCrDHIA	1 star because the service by the blonde snotty teenage cashier really made me & my boyfriend's experience here poor.  I had to greet her, she looked annoyed that she had to help another customer, and my questions were answered with short, blunt, minimal answers. Needless to say she didn't assist me with anything other than taking my money. Good thing she doesn't work on tips! Food was pretty good, but then I just saw them on Dirty Dining this evening eeeeekkkk! So now I;m seriously not going back. Crappy service and demerits for cleanliness? No thanks.
UI6-uJvReEbtZgo-Pg3Jjw	Reminded me of a Panera with slightly nicer ingredients. Never better breakfast selection and lunch and they marry their ketchup so watch out
FXKSExJCPyjx9EKBCQrgoA	Cheap price but large value, the potatoes taste amazing!  Location is great, near street and besides the Jean Talon Market.
iXb2a03liLpIAGmaoffUFw	Great Hummus!  If you're at the Jean Talon market, make sure you stop by for some great vegetarian food.  The place was clean and prices are reasonable.  I'm from NYC and was in town for a couple of days.  It was the best hummus I had in Montreal.  And free wifi as well, which was greatly needed since I was out of my network. I regret I didn't try the roasted potatoes or rice and lentils...they looked really good.
aU-Jyu6LrCayCqv5igoz1Q	Nourriture pourrie. Tomates aucunement fraiches. Worst lebanese food i've ever tasted in my life. Chicken was fatty. Half of my wife's chicken plate was fat. I've called the owner explaining the situation. All he said was.... Oh sorry.   Really not a great experience.   Do not eat there!!!!!!  Gross
FyW01BFHuFp0w_WaIuUN5Q	i was in the mood for some poutine, shawarma poutine to be exact and instead of going to a more safer choice, decided to head down to the market for some franchised lebanese.. truth be told, should have not.  mind you, the food was tasty enough but nothing to rave about. first, its located just outside marché jean-talon making access easy. secondo, its big enough with plenty of tables. thirdly, its clean, not rundown like the usual lebanese fast food joints.  now, that poutine. instead of regular fries, i went with the option of garlic potatoes which added more flavor to the dish. if you like garlic and i mean, really like garlic, this is a good choice. the shawarma was salty and almost melt in your mouth with some fatty slices here and there. the curds were fresh and squeaky. the gravy though, at best it was warmish. each components on their own were decently good. together, they didn't sing at all because of the gravy. no melting cheese, no warmth, no comfort food feeling.  and the service was fucking slow! the place wasn't busy at all, barely any patrons which is pretty much the case every time yet, it managed to be incredibly slow.  i wanted to love that shawarma poutine but in the end, it was disappointing
OUa1KxsrLkk4mqxJuhy2Tg	Great middle eastern food and the quality is spot on.  I had the chicken and Shawerma combo plate.  The beef and chicken are both lean and tender.  Potatoes and rice very well cooked.
K4AmBxv-iaRLc4-CCqBV2g	Eat here! This place looks like nothing special from the outside, and is essentially a cafeteria-style joint with several pre-set options on a lit board above the counter, but the food is awesome!   We decided to eat here after circling the Jean-Talon market and figuring that Lebanese is always good, even if it's just simple dips or mezza.   My husband had the combo plate with chicken and beef shawarma, potatoes, rice, salad, hummus and garlic sauce for $10.99. Holy deliciousness!! The garlic sauce alone was so awesome we could have just eaten that with pita and been super happy (and probably gained several pounds...). The portion was large - almost too much for my husband to eat, and that's saying a lot since he is usually the last one standing at big meals and is often referred to as having two stomaches. Meat was also juicy with crispy pieces and well seasoned, and the salad was a fresh mix of lettuce and spinach, with tomato, onion and pickled veggies. Really great balance. And great value.  I had the vegetarian combo plate with 3 cold salads. There were maybe 10 options to choose from, and I picked lentils and rice; fatoush; and a tourlou-like mix of eggplant, peppers and chick peas in a savory tomato sauce. Eaten with pita, the flavors and textures were totally satisfying. Loved it.  Our only regret is that we didn't have enough time during our weekend in Montreal to go back - but we definitely will next time we are in town. Do yourself a favor and go there now, and often! So fresh, healthy and delicious!
_9TMgVp_fFeExSFMkF9RzA	Falafels should be freshly deep-fried at the time of your order.   Yesterday evening I purchased falafel sandwiches and some sides for my family at Restaurant Basha by the Jean-Talon market for dinner and I was so disappointed when I saw the guy put cold balls of falafel into our pitas. What?!?!? The whole point of going to a restaurant to have a falafel as opposed to making them at home is that I am paying a premium to have the restaurant deep-fry the falafel balls for me at the time of my order. If I wanted cold falafel balls, well then I could have made them myself at home.  *sigh*  I held out hope that even though the falafels were cold that perhaps they might still taste good but my concerns were spot on as soon as I bit into my sandwich. Honestly, I did not even finish it; something that has never happened before when eating a falafel sandwich. When my husband heard my complaints about how incredibly disappointed I was with our falafel sandwiches he responed with, "I have never had hot falafels in a pita before. Do they taste better?" Taste better?! They are night and day!!!! This is tantamount to eating cold french fries. Since I am not from Canada, I wondered out-loud "are all falafel sandwiches served with cold falafel balls everywhere in Montreal? Dear god, what a terrible tragedy!"  Sadly, after reading several reviews regarding restaurants serving falafel sandwiches in Montreal, it appears that is the case. Since my craving for a proper falafel sandwich was not satisfied by Basha, we will need to find a restaurant in Montreal that actually fries the falafel balls. I need for my husband to know the hot, crispy and spicy goodness of a proper falafel pita sandwich.
8r34BP_J8LTptPXU824YqQ	I came here when my normal Starbucks was filled with so many first day holiday drink and gift shoppers that I decided not to wait at my normal stop.  I had remembered it mentioned that there was a Starbucks at Macy's and I decided to give it a try.  The outlet is on the southwest corner of Macy's in Downtown Summerlin.  There is a metal gate that blocks people from arriving/leaving Starbucks via Macy's unless the store is open.  There is a door on the outside sidewalk that bypasses the store and allows access to Starbucks.  Since it was early, I got a spot to park on the street.  Since it's so close to the garage, there are only a few spaces near the corner but I snagged one of them and walked to Starbucks.  The baristas were pleasant and made my drink quickly.  It was also a very quiet place with only a few customers.  It's a small outlet owned by Starbucks and operated by employees of Macy's.    This certainly will be an option when I'm in Downtown Summerlin.  There was no up pricing as there is at the two locations in Red Rock Casino.  That's good!
92IiF_pR2oH_Zy4YG1rr1g	The staff was understaffed and they STILL took care of everyone flawlessly they were polite and efficient definitely coming back great drinks too I got a chestnut praline latte Sooooo good
mceZC1imQNSMSXb0eh6hag	horrible. starbucks wasnt on the directory so for me who has never bern here before i couldnt find it. oh but its inside macys. a drink was still $5.50 for crap. only ended up drinking half of it soo gross
SFENTj5TtPad21xMoAvP7Q	Prices are very high at this Starbucks. It also is not at a good location at downtown Summerlin. It should have its own store front. It's always very crowded and they've gotten my drink wrong twice.
iR0HA7VU9jCxerUaBcYRPA	Coffee to me isn't just a drink it's a lifestyle. Regrettably, this insignificant Starbuck's inside of Macy's is the exclusive coffee house to satisfy the coffee lovers lifestyle in Downtown Summerlin      Oftentimes but not every time, I frequent Downtown Summerlin, it is after an exhausting hike in the open spaces contiguous to Las Vegas. My first stop is to walk inside of Macy's to make a beeline for the Starbuck's by the east entrance.      Frequently this Starbuck's has a line of people. It is obvious that the demand exceeds the supply. There are only a few tables that fill up and limited space to move around the diminutive room. You would think that a regional shopping destination would have an inviting cafe with a sundry and variety of seating including outdoor seating. You wouldn't think that the sole coffee house would be one of the tiniest in the City of Las Vegas. The upshot is that I usually buy the cup of coffee to go where I will savour it outside at the water feature or by the arroyo park.      When coffee is not just a drink but a lifestyle, you don't mind paying inexorbitant prices for it. This location is not off the charts highly priced like some of the Las Vegas Strip locations but it is more than the average Starbuck's owned locations. This Macy's owned Starbuck's does  charge 27 cents over and above for drip coffee.     Ultimately when coffee is a lifestyle, you do things like review it on Yelp. The only discouraging thing is that  the only coffee house we can currently review in Downtown Summerlin is this pocket-size Starbuck's inside the men's department of Macy's.
hgkXhDr6YZBKVZtaPQ3J4Q	I was there last night with my friend from 7:30pm to closing , 8:30pm I guess is their closing time. Had a really bad experience with the baristas . The Hispanic barista who helped us at te counter was so rude to not explain thoroughly about one of our order. On their board it says green tea and white tea , that being said we thought it's a combination of both, but instead the other guy barista said "oh it's a typo, don't know why it's even there," what a poor customer service. Me and my friend were still thinking abot the order and the girl barista's like "huh?". Wow! Is that a way to ask a customer about an order? We let all of it pass, we just proceed with our tea lattes and a dessert and hanged out. A Hispanic girl, black guy and a white guy barista on duty that night. The girl and the white boy was flirting with each other whenever there's no one on their counter to order. Here comes 8:30pm, the white boy came to us and said "we're closed." These people need to be trained with their customer service abilities. At the very end, we were never given a good customer service, we just have to deal with them because we really love Starbucks.
Twbc9gjJAFLWqK0GftJVjQ	Took my three boys here for their holiday haircuts. Walked in looking shaggy and walked out looking like male models!  Excellent job with the kids and very family friendly. Angelo was there and did a fine job. I would recommend to anyone!!!    Price beats anyone and quality is above and beyond anyone else!  We will return!
mnbn_TzfaNSQMEAorcq6sQ	Cuts for me and 3 sons.  Much better than that sports place - these guys actually know how to blend a cut!  Actually, that's not given them enough credit.  It had been way too long for all of us, but we all walked out with best haircut in years.    I'd give 5 starts easy, but i wish they had evening hours at least once or twice during the week.  We'll still go, but it means my wife has to take them after her work , or I have to use time on Saturday for a haircut which I don't like to do.  FYI: Cash only.
GtyhlO_Whg7oCPbDT7f2OQ	Angelo's is the best "old school" barber shop in Gilbert, maybe the whole East Valley. The shop is easy to find, clean and the warm reception I got as a new customer was exceptional. After my cut, my wife said, wow, you look like a new man! Lucky me, thanks to Angelo. He used to own an Italian Restaurant in Maryland, so if you enjoy good food, he's got some good stories. "Try it, You'll  Like It"  Boston Bob from Gilbert, AZ
09snCwOZgj9t-vzZcm8hVQ	Another great flat top at Angelos.  This is my Third visit, and I am completely satisfied with my haircut. The atmosphere is relaxed, and friendly. This place reminds me of the old fashioned barbershop that my dad would take me to. If you are interested in the flat top, ask for Angelo himself. He is the best at it. The other barbers do a great job as well. When they are finishing, they use this massager on your scalp, neck, shoulders, and arms. It is very relaxing.  This place is the best, I won't go anywhere else.
tgqTrWLAcg_KM8LRtJQKwA	Great place to get a hair cut definitely my new barber shop great barbers good cuts thanks for making me look fresh
nnohQ1whine5pLjSypUtxg	Awesome great barber shop!! Very friendly barbers and also kid friendly!! Highly recommended for a barber shop! Definitely will return!! However the only downfall is to make sure you bring cash when you come; they do not take any cards!!
O_nYkQI9lsTc7D97UHq6JA	Walked in with my son to get haircuts and we weren't greeted in any way.  Both barbers on duty looked up at us, but didn't acknowledge us whatsoever.  Would like to have been told how long of a wait or how many people were ahead of us, but got nothing....not even a "hello".  They only accept cash (huh?).
kWPuASunFZYEE6itCGFiDA	These guys are awesome. Each barber has a specific style so try them all and then stick with the one you like but they're each VERY good at their respective styles.
J1Qihwbgwpk2g595DVWTtQ	I just had one of the worst experiences of my life at Angelo's Barber shop #2 in Gilbert, Az. It wasn't with my haircut. The owner is about a 70 yr old Italian man. He was born and raised there and came to America 40 yrs ago. My barber Bianca is a Latin female and is awesome. As she is cutting my hair, we were having a conversation in Spanish. After a while he yells out this is America, speak English! I of course kept speaking Spanish. I was boiling but kept calm. Anyway there was a couple & their 3 sons waiting to get their hair cut and we're speaking in another language. I asked them what language they were speaking and they said Portuguese. I told them to be careful as they might be asked to shut up. Angelo the owner didn't say a dam thing. This is the same guy that when the old school Italians come in, he chats it up in his Italian language. It's his shop I get it and he can do what he wants. But to me that's hipocrisy. I was so disgusted with this after 4 years of supporting this barber shop, I shook all of the barbers hands and told them that was that last time I would go to that barber shop. The sad thing is that I was the 5th person this week that experienced this. According to the barbers anyway. I'm an American Citizen and I can speak whatever language I want to. Isn't this the home of the brave and the land of the free? All I know is that prejudice/racism is alive and well. Just because you don't go through this shitty experience, it doesn't mean it doesn't exist. Be mindful of others. Be the best you, you can possibly be. Even when nobody's watching. Don't forget where you came from people. We are all from somewhere, so get off your freaken high horse's and be good to others. How is this for my good Friday!
4--SInDn3JHfd_8pePgjXw	This is the real deal.  Angelo is the best barber I've met. He doesn't put up with bull though.  Amazing place and person
9sd1JVNsm2O-Qy0zU3u1PQ	Good place for carne Asad fries. Only beans and Pico de Gallo are not offered with the plate you have to get those separately if you wish. Great Aguas frescas ( jamaica and horchata)
oWGtZwCEhXYfEbafYj4w3Q	Tried a carne asada taco, wasn't anything special. The guy behind the counter was pretty nice but I think he was doing everything himself! Taking orders from both the counter and drive thru and I think he was doing the cooking too! I might give it another try just to give something else a try but honestly don't have my hopes up too high.
zwGdkxCHYJ5jJxWAbVG3RQ	bigger is better the burritos & combos make the other places look like kids meals...great food super!
-JF3wNGNAMrpxxKCTdU7WA	Food was always good when it was Ubaldo's Taco Shop. It's even better now that it is Rosendo's Taco Shop. The food, the menu, the  ordering process, and wait time are all much better now.
iMUOXrIlCKNC2MxHtv4Ujg	The food is delicious. Reasonably priced. The restaurant itself could use a good cleaning and organizing. It looks like they gave up in the middle of a remodel or repair. The girl at the counter was very sweet.   The beef in the tacos is succulent and flavorful. Nice crispy shells without being tough. The beans and rice were seasoned nicely and cooked properly.   They have a very complete menu with lots of choices.
PpwghPiPqDcJk-IMH6YqXw	I was very impressed with Touchstone Gallery. While I'm not the kind who can afford the larger pieces, I was impressed with both the high quality of mineral specimens used and the creative elegance. You'd be surprised how many other stores & galleries can take beautiful rocks and minerals and make awkward or unattractive furnishings. That was not a problem here.  I really liked the jewelry, and felt the prices were very fair for such elegant one-of-a-kind pieces.   Lastly, the customer service was exceptional. I was offered bottled water when I entered, and was treated very kindly even though I made it very clear I was only browsing, not buying. Thank you, Jacob.
97e4QijnGLsqbrV6Ia_FGQ	Gorgeous presentation of fossils, petrified wood and minerals! Walking into this gallery was treat. It is a naturalist's haven. The store is well organized and all items were beautifully displayed. My favorite pieces were the fish fossils that look like that they were paintings. The geodes displayed were also lovely. The jewelry for sale was also exquisite. I can't wait to visit and purchase a piece or two to showcase in our classroom. Prices are a little on the higher side, but you get what you pay.
M8yliKBsmgtj7u84c6CwHg	I drove from Chandler to shop & the store is closed before 4pm. It looked nice from the window.
XjdkvQvRFRA2nHXeRrB27A	Love this store!  Great selection of high quality and name brand clothes and accessories.  You can get nearly new for less than half the price.
Dp37m3FJEGbxRkqrltRn3Q	I was pleasantly surprised at how nice the store was, clean and very organized.. it is a bit of a drive for me, but after going there, I wouldn't go to any other store.. I usually feel smothered at other stores, not here. According to my kids,, they have everything that's in fashion today.lol
v-WKVR9AZQV4BBiPiaa38g	I absolutely love this place. Everything is displayed beautifully and items are priced very reasonable for all parties involved as it is a consignment store. The employees are very nice and friendly and the owner is amazing.  I help the homeless by passing out items and she donates to the cause:)  So really this shop is a win win for all involved. NOTHING GOES TO WASTE. so if you are looking to buy or consigner please go check Twice A Round out.  CALL FOR STORE HOURS JUST IN CASE.
t-LlW3SDZrXSjPYIof6t6g	I love this shop! They have such nice things and great prices. Twice around consignment is a little gem of a shop.
eqLAIhGQzixoMTCbEq98rQ	Great training for kids and adults! BJJ, Kickboxing, MMA, Judo, this place has it all! Come in and talk to coach June Bug!
ZTrDn2JKXC3cUS1gjyXq3Q	If you are looking for physical conditioning this gym provides that and more. My grandchildren have been trained by coach June Bug and they have not only learned Marshal Arts skills but also have learned  the benefits of discipline and hard work. Coach June Bug is a skilled and encouraging coach. All ages are welcome.
OO7NxYwXvbeyBqS05m9cQg	Great.
yuRtrOCZ9qmThM9GWQhN7Q	I recently enrolled my two kids at the 9th Isle BJJ due to the professionalism, hard working attitudes & dedication of the instructors and the student in all ranks. Both my kids already had some martial arts experience in the past & I wanted to kick it up a notch by getting them into BJJ. I know this was a great choice & looking forward towards the future. I love it & my kids do too. I highly recommend this studio if you have what it takes to be a quality fighter in this game. Not everyone will be a Champions. Here you will earn it. They have a wall to prove it.
TrX-JgqUtRh8EumIsdrVtw	Some of the most humble and nicest trainers( and classmates) I've met. They work with you regardless of what you skill level is. Classes are kept small, therefore you learn much more in detail while the instructor is constantly giving great tips and tricks, almost one-on-one, while training. Great atmosphere, everyone is family there and they welcome new comers as one of their own!
ni4c4CHQwRYafjOiQuqGcQ	We just loved Louie. He has started some work for us and he like family. I'm so excited to work with Louie. He the man! Knows he plants. Patient with all our questions. His work is amazing.
todk8VSmebX0l3yVOl1XtQ	AWFUL EXPERIENCE with the owner Louie Maldonado and the work that was done in my yard.  Paid $3,550.00 for 200 sq ft. of fake grass surrounded by all rocks.  Within a few months, noticed alot of weeds growing.  (I had asked about tarp under the rocks before the work was started as the other half of my yard with rocks has tarp under it)  He did not put anything under the rocks.  Phone call  to tell him my problem in the yard and they returned and sprayed "weed killer" after I pulled all the weeds myself.  Within days I had double the amount of weeds.  Called back and suggested he fix the problem.    Arguing occurred and we agreed on me paying $170.00 for them to pull back the rocks and lay down tarp - (I shouldn't have had to pay anything!!!!)  Within days the far side of the yard next to side of house and several areas throughout the yard had ALOT of weeds growing again.  Looked for tarp and couldn't find ANY! Called Louie and expressed my concern that his guys did not cover  all of the areas.  He wanted more money to fix it!  I said, NO!  He took attitude with me, said he will give me back my $170.00 and said "try to get it fixed for cheaper" and hung up on me.  I texted him, "please send me back my $170.00".  He replied ok.  Posted on BBB my first complaint and he got notice of it.  Called me and said if I don't take it off, he will not refund my $170.00.  I did NOT remove the review.  I am Highly Disgusted with how he treated me as a customer.  I would never recommend his company to anyone.
qsxqnPtLz2T67bdkOvhGTQ	Not sure how this company holds an A+ rating with the bbb. I've had nothing but problems since day one. I will say the yard clean up went well but when I contracted for monthly service, they failed. They didn't trim the shrubs per our agreement and when I called to inform them so they could come back and correct the situation. ...I was ignored. No response period. So two weeks later i get ahold of them and they said they would not return to address the issues until next week. Needless to say...I fired them.
jbaY_PxpHvY-q834CNv_LQ	Very disappointed in this company! We thought they were going to be a good company to work with as the owner is very nice, personable and seemed very attentive. Turns out, they're like many out there that do what they can to get your business and then it all goes to... Well you know!  Time to start over and find someone who truly wants our business.
hoLy9rBydksTkk6UILVYYw	We started off well. We got a one time yard clean up and landscape lighting replaced - This went very well. After which the service gradually went bad. As it turns out the service is farmed out to another crew and I was never told about this. When I called to cancel my service with "Desert Landscape and Pools", they did not return my call/email nor did they have the courtesy to take care of the closing of the account. I was asked to call the people doing my yard and close out my account myself. I wont use them again.
Gz5ufvzJNH7mLyTO8BD3kw	First and foremost let me just say I love this place!! Chow time is amazing. The food is great and the people who work their are terrific. It's not your normal food truck the food is always freshly made and has the most amazing taste from the Chipotle burger to their pulled pork sandwiches everything is seasoned amazingly. The owner and his family really put everything they have into serving you the best BBQ. As long as you don't mind having a seat outside close the food truck where you can hear the cook at work and smell everything then you'll love this place,they cater as well and you can get your food to go. Check them out you won't regret it!!
DjXeGf1OJrfteMQP29CPow	When I first approached the truck the guy was short and looked like he was drunk and high..after about an hour of waiting for our food..it came in and the fries tasted like fish, like it was fried in the same 0ld fryer..and so cold!! I walked out to see where my friends food was..since they had ordered before us and the guy cussed at me and told me that he would issue a refund then asked how I paid and then proceeded to tell me that I was a liar and slammed the window in my face and said that he would have my fucking food out shortly..so I kept calling for him and he was ignoring me..once I proceeded to walk back outside I demanded a refund he gave me my cash back and slammed the window in my face and said your 4.50 will not make my night!! This was thee worst customer service I've ever had at a food truck..this man is a disgrace to the hard working people!! I would never recommend anyone to this low life!!
9wHD1Txc2kUcLIT_vC0rcg	I recently had an experience with chow time tonight , to say the least it was absolutely a trainwreck . I ordered 2 items and waited over an hour to not even receive our food . In between waiting for our food , atleast 3 separate orders that were ordered after mine were delivered , without a trace of my order in sight. He forgot our order .  I went outside of tenaya creek to check on my order and the man handed me two old chili cheese french fries loaded with jalapenos. ~That was not my order.   I proceeded to tell him that was not my order. I got a brief slam of the food truck window and the man said  " ill bring your food to you when it's f***ing ready ".    What a horrible food experience . Thankfully I got my refund and The man said " that isn't going to make or break my night ." Ok you won't have my business or any of my friends that frequently visit tenaya creek brewery anymore . Do not recommend .
-SpH9eXHRWJPt0NPwPEpvQ	Let me start off by saying that my review is based on the experience I received with a group of my friends..we all had the WORST experience at this food truck a few nights back. The man was so rude and unprofessional. Waited over an hour for our food, the food was cold, the frys tasted like fish (cooking oil had clearly not beem changed), and he "forgot" to bring out the other half of our group's order, he said it was ready and would bring it right in..25 minutes later, we go outside to see what's going on, and he yelled and cussed is out, slammed the window closed in our face (mid sentence). I did not wait this long, pay so much (including a tip that I wished I didn't give), to be treated the way we did. To sum it up, he only refunded half our money (stating that "our f*cking money won't make his night), we never got the rest of our food, and ended up throwing away the food we did get. I don't know how much more unprofessional you can get. Terrible experience..buyers beware.
Y2qSa1hhqmQxXU6IYy9uCQ	Just ate from this food truck at the Tenaya Creek  Brewery.....Amazing! I loved the smokey hickory  taste I got from my burger. We also had the garlic parm fries and shared btw 4 people....so garlicky!I went to culinary  school so I'm picky but I approve of this place. I can totally tell that the cook is a hard working veteran and cares about what he does.
wdQ6nlBviYBrWSlnlL7CmQ	I got a few tri tip sandwiches to take to work for me and my girlfriend. They were ok. Service was good. Man was nice. I didnt have anywhere near the same experience as the previous reviwers who all posted the same review, my service was fine with only a six or seven minute wait
zPQsxDRQNtdcjeEmqYvYwQ	Great food from genuine great people. Each day the menu has something fresh and different. Love it when the smoked meats come out! Professional and clean, the slander I see here is rubbish. God would send his/her mother to Chow Time to pick up a sandwich. Believe.
EI5osHR2LHcOhJkDdq4xyQ	I've been a fan of The Fresh Market for a while now but it's always been a little far from me. Now they've opened this location right next to my house and I'm so excited about it!   My first trip to this new location was on grand opening night so the store was packed! The first thing I noticed about the store is the size, it's fairly small and with the crowed from opening night that didn't help. Once you get past the size you see how nice, organized and well put together this store is. This is't my everyday grocery store but more for fresh ingredients. They've got the freshest produce, seafood and meats in the area, way above the quality you'd expect from a grocery store. There's a wide variety of fresh breads and chesses along with prepared food. In addition to all the fresh food the customer service is outstanding! From the management to the cashiers all the employees have a pleasant smile and warm personality.  I'm looking forward to many more trips to The Fresh Market!
0DNy3e4esnGlYjeEIobCzQ	Are you really, really rich?  Then you should shop here on the regular.  Fresh Market is less than two miles from a Harris Teeter and a Trader Joe's- very bold Fresh Market.  I was impressed with some BOGO offerings and stocked up on Pro Bars that my boyfriend loves but overall their meats and cheeses are muy moolah. Nothing compares to the cheese price and selection at Trader Joe's just a few steps down the block.  Would I come for speciality items or if I wanted some expensive candy to impress my boss or something? Probably yeah, but unless this store is running a 50% off sale there are places to buy similar quality with a larger selection (this store is tiny) and less money.
TSItktRGkFIXVfHBEZAcog	Ok I'm  just going to start off by saying The Fresh Market is the only place that I have found in Charlotte that makes fresh eclairs almost as good as my old bakery in VA. named Brenner's which has been closed for some years now. The pastry shell filled with great tasting custard and top with rich tasty chocolate is definitely the 2nd best eclair I have ever had. The is meat is so fresh and they will custom make sausage and custom cut meat for you. Wide variety of sausage that they make there. I got some nice size crab legs from here. It's a nice local fresh or organic store that's very clean. The staff are friendly, knowlegeable, nice, and eager to help you. You gotta come in a get the whole experience yourself, it is too many nice things about this place to try to put all in this review. So glad that they replace the Food Lion that was here previously...
j1RnSuhzZgDy7jKS5DdqeA	I'm a couponer, not a member of the bourgeoisie. This place is like a palace of a grocery store, with prices to match. I was able to find a couple of things that were comparable to what I am used to spending, but only a few. If you are looking for high end delicacies, they've got them. If you are looking for affordable groceries to fill your pantry with, check elsewhere. Beautiful store, just a little bit out of my price range.
YhgRRjHRsZraq8e1vZ57UA	I am a Fresh Market fan and have been shopping them for years elsewhere. This store has a new open design which makes it easier to navigate. I have been to this new location (near me), about 6 times and EVERY TIME they are out of stock on at LEAST one item that I came in for! I spoke to the manager who gave me a song and dance about how many people he interviewed to select his staff, and that there was a learning curve for his staff. I wonder if anyone from headquarters has visited this store to witness the low stock levels. Even the cheese bin is not piled high like other locations. The pièce de résistance was them being out of fresh breads at 10 AM two days before New Years!  First impressions count most and if I were new to Fresh Market and experience the outages I did, I would not return very often. I think this location needs a new manager to beef up his inventory. At their price point, I expect only the very best in service my money is buying. I'm being generous with 3 stars.
m8i3qnWbIuopI5m3iS9OOQ	The three stars are based on price not shopping experience or variety of goods for sale. Fresh Market is similar to Whole Foods but smaller and less organic. They've got deli, meat counter, fresh produce, bakery, floral. Everything is neatly stocked and fresh looking. They have all the specialty pantry items you could want. Imagine the selection at Williams Sonoma but greater. The candy aisle is impressive just as the coffee selection. I like coming here for meats and specialty goods but I can't imagine getting all my groceries here or I'd be broke!
Uamhl838xKpXcMnwaAStuw	I love the fresh market and love how there's one on this side of town! Yes it's a little pricey and yes you have to be careful not to spend too much if that's a concern, but you can find some very fresh and interesting things here! Also I've found their flowers to be very fresh and lasting! I used to get flowers from Trader Joes a lot, but found that several times they barely lasted. I'm much happier occasionally purchasing flowers here for the random pick me up. I do agree with other reviewers that you can find better deals at Traders or HT on a lot of stuff, but that doesn't mean this isn't a great little store.
DaGozzc6o2tWURXDfT0mjQ	For our housewarming party, we decided to get deli trays from our local Fresh Market.  Their Web site showed us a good variety of trays, with pictures, descriptions, options, estimated number of people served and pricing.  We selected the Italian meat and cheese tray, crudité, pinwheels and a desert tray.  It would have been a little better if the Web site prompted us for the meat/cheese combos we wanted for the pinwheels and the dressing for the crudité.  We put that info in the comments field on the checkout screen and they got it right.  (In my experience, most businesses never read those comments.) They had everything ready, properly stored in their walk-in.  Ingredients were all first rate.  All the deli trays had a bed of lettuce on the bottom.  Everything was beautifully arranged.  The Italian meat and cheese tray was the biggest hit, followed by the desert tray.  We had crudité and pinwheels left over - those trays were much better stocked than we expected. The Fresh Market will definitely be our Go To for future party tray needs.
PIvYpdbTueVFjt86C95rng	The Fresh Market opened up very close to where I live and I was excited to have a new option to grocery shop that isn't Harris Teeter! When they first opened the place would get pretty busy. Now it seems like the hype has settled down and it doesn't get quite as busy. The Fresh Market is good for some things and not great for others.   I would say that the quality of the meat that you can buy here is probably some of the better options available in the area. The price for the meat is pretty expensive but when they have deals on certain meats it makes it reasonable. Same goes for the seafood and produce. I would never do my full grocery shopping for the week here.  The prepared foods offer some great grab and go items for a quick lunch or dinner. The prices are reasonable and won't break the bank.   My favorite item the store has is the bulk candy that you can purchase by the pound.
qHDinSgQXFG3MVofVWfMXA	while the store is pretty and large, but customer service leaves much to be desired! The deli department is also filthy. I saw two workers kill a fly in a container with meat and then do nothing but walk away. I also ordered a sandwich and it was completely wrong. When I called back there was no apology whatsoever. Do your self a favor and go to Trader Joe's.
0a3Uf95Fet1iqqKnrqC_UA	I enjoy this store mainly for the produce and bakery departments. Very fresh and a good variety but you pay for it. The meat and deli departments look good too but the prices are higher than I'm willing to pay. I always feel out of place there in my Harley Davidson t-shirt and jeans and the classical music playing in the background...lol. It's a little fancy.
xE_TuGBWIW1DACFE5SyRQA	I enjoy coming to TFM for specialties. The seafood bar and olive bar are great. The smoked salmon salad is so delish! They have tons of hidden treasures....hard to find teas and health tonics and beverages. Lots of healthy options! Also for salad lovers--watercress! That's hard to find anywhere but they keep it in stock. A great bakery, fresh produce, lots of options for healthy snacks too and the cheese section has some of the best. I definitely wouldn't shop for the week but it's. Great place to treat yourself. You deserve it !
70ucCScyi4FEPlxOU4YH7Q	The store is nice, clean, and organized well. It is a relaxing environment to do your shopping. The people are friendly and helpful.  The are not out of stock of anything frequently.  Nice place.  Need more cashiers at lunch though!
7qP346diP-pbvw1H_co7tg	Most of their meat is of good quality, fresh and organic, but other than the meat there was a very limited selection of organic items available.
mj570VeyO72n6SPUb3mhzQ	I have been a fan of the Fresh Market since I was a child. I would always get a bag of licorice and an IBC root beer. That hasn't changed but I have added some more items to my regularly bought list like the deviled egg potato salad from the deli. It is highly addictive! Or the lemon poppy muffins...so moist, and big, and delicious! They always have a great selection of meat in the butcher shop and the freshest produce.
hncnevax2X0ksr7BN1K7sg	Excellente cuisine Mexicaine authentique tout était délicieux le service était super aussi
9c9ErXFrelpIfisZAoYAcQ	100% Ratatouille experience!   Excellent Sunday brunch option (Closed on Saturday's). A four month old Mexican jewel at Dorval. So good that is like having food at your grandma' kitchen.   It worth the detour, refined taste & presentation. Unmatched authentic flavour. Generous portions. Oh, and ridiculously friendly staff. I really hope this guys stay around for a long while.
IncZbHi1ELC8B2aAfo_3uQ	There's not many good Mexican restaurants in pointe Claire let alone the west island but this place is worth a shot. The restaurant is not the fanciest of places but that's ok! The food speaks wonders for it! I had the fajitas and they were absolutely wonderful! Full of flavour. They also give you warm tortillas. They're served on a cast iron skillet and you assemble them yourself. Give this place a chance and help them prosper because they definitely deserve it. I'll be frequenting here again!!!
2tUYQexPTLLCMkacnxDBdA	Wow !!!!  Homemade and soooooo good!   Such a hidden little location, but so worth it.  She does offer catering as well.  This is traditional , straight from Mexico City.   I ordered the quesadillas which is 3 tortillas with beef.  The beef is delicious , not too spicy.   Guac is zesty with lemon, and the salsa is to die for. So glad we came here
SXb0m0oDTBkUcvxMB_7Uhg	What a find (thank you Yelp)!  West Island eating just got  better with the addition of this simple, fresh and authentic Mexican restaurant. Ok so the decor and location aren't much but the food is wonderful - a perfect balance of freshness and heat. As you're seated you're served with freshly made warm tortilla chips and small bowls of red and green house salsas.  The red was very good, the green was great - a little bit tangy, medium spicy and a nice "green" flavour. I wish they sold it in jars!  I followed up with the cactus salad (very generous portion for $5.00). The cactus was nicely marinated, served with a nicely balanced mix of fresh red and yellow bell peppers and red onion and dressed with a simple vinaigrette and a nice sprinkling of fresh oregano.  The tortilla soup was simply amazing and probably one of the top 5 soups I have ever tasted (and I eat soup almost every single day). Cooked chicken, tortilla strips and fresh avocado floated in a bowl of rich chicken stock bolstered by ancho chili, ground tomato, a little lime and fresh cilantro. I like spicy but I don't like to break out into a sweat and I don't lien the heat to drown out everything else. This soup was loaded with layers of flavour that blended beautifully and still left just the right amount of burn on the back of my throat. I have sampled a lot of tortilla soups in a lot of places and this was a standout!  I asked what was in the soup that made it so tasty and without missing a beat the owner replied - "love". I believe her.  My wife ordered the guacamole which was served with the same house-made tortillas and was slightly  chunky with the perfect amount of cilantro, lime juice and slivered red onion. Instead of regular tomatoes they used grape tomatoes cut in half which was brilliant considering at this time of year they have so much more flavour than their larger counterparts.  This place is unassuming but definitely worth a visit if you like Mexican even just a little bit.
DXD2Es26-GJStluAelXvdQ	Great hole in the wall! Delicious food and very friendly. Highly recommended!! I had the Huevos Rancheros from the brunch menu and it was amazing. Big serving and the prices are not bad at all.  Service in Spanish, English and French. Hablan español!
Kpfw3Kr1vtUlClC6YHjgxA	Such a disappointment for many reasons...I was under the impression that this was a Resto.It is not.It is a 15 seat Cantina inside an Industrial Office Building.Very hard to find, and was not expecting what I saw once entered the establishment.The Owner/Chef was running around trying to satisfy 10-12 orders and drowning by doing so.There is no Liquor licence, but also no BYOB.....you can have water or Mexican Soft Drinks.... After all this,the food was surprisingly really good. Best Guacamole ever, and Fajitas were Really tasty with Black Beans. The dining experience is not a dining experience, but rather more suited to a call in and pick up...... Final surprise after eating our meal, Cash only please. .?????There is an ATM across the street....oooomph. And, here is the key to the Washroom down the Hall.... My thoughts are that this venue serves really good and authentic Mexican food with Red and Green Salsa extras, but is located in the wrong place.... Hoping they can afford to move to somewhere more visual..... My heart goes out to them because it would be a loss not to have this food experience again.....Maybe a Food Truck? Good Luck.....
-Fejxxt9adPbWYT8jwkiDw	30 min still no food, had to walk out, cooks had no hair net watsoever with long curly hair, kitchen wide open from the bathroom view ? Gross.
Gm6TurwVuad3W4oWpdre8Q	Very good breakfast. Option toast or biscuits and gravy (good). One of the best breakfast places we have found in Apache Junction. Big crowd on Sunday morning. Everything is clean and good service. We recommend this to everyone.
z3qVpDv3x-F829lw_eTMLA	Worst service I have ever had at a restaurant.  there were only 8 tables and we waited 45 minutes to eat.  the pancakes were raw and gritty, the potatoes were under cooked, tasted boiled with no seasoning and their home made sausage sucked.  then when we complained all the lady whose name we did not get, say that we just had a bad experience.  I have served my whole life, this place's customer service was not up to par.  there were alot more people there that also were complaining and it took up to 20 minutes for them to bring more plates to a round table with 6 people.  I will never eat here again and will spread the word.  worse ever.  Wanted not to pay but I did.  and the lady who serviced us was very rude.
EGqyqp_PQggsXsUv-FgPpw	The restaurant was pleasant. Service was excellent. Food was excellent. I had the corned beef hash and eggs. Excellent! You should go here!
dkIbcslM0Ccdk49bKbZU-Q	This was our second attempt to have a meal.  First time we had lunch there; wait service incredibly slow but finally got our meal, which was mediocre at best.  Today, after calling first to ensure they were open, I was told by someone that they were open until 2.  At 1:10 we pulled in just to be rudely told they closed at 1:00.  When I pointed out someone had just told me on the phone they were opened until 2 this person told me, well, they were wrong.  Wow.  Thanks for wasting my time and gas.  And by the way, this website lists the operating hours as being open until 8 PM.  No way to run a business.  And you've lost mine.  Never again.
g0OxacVaS4tPbfh79lQJ_w	We tried Sunday breakfast, we expected it to take awhile but finally getting our food an hour after being seated was ridiculous.  My husband's French toast was burned & soggy skinny bacon. I had a chorizo burrito & very little chorizo. Then we had to ask for our check.Will not be returning.
NuoRqAzUszEb8CypTg6bTw	We were hoping for more Indiana type food. I did get the tenderloin. It was OK.  Just your typical side stop restaurant.
VxDey9ocdW4fjSRaM_9DxA	Great family style restaurant with good home cooking! Brought the kids for breakfast and everyone was happy. We will definitely come back again!!!
_ZoODNLQWfGaWdq40zq80g	I was having a problem with my RO system I was not getting water I looked on Yelp and called the first name that was there he was booked up for 2 weeks and a half I didn't want to wait that long call me in patient but I love my RO water and don't want to do without it long story short I went back on Yelp and found Christopher James the second name on the list Thank You Yelp I do have to say and you let me start with if there was more stars than 5 Christopher would have got every star I called him and he fit me in that day actually within a couple of hours he walked me through what was wrong how it could possibly happen and walked me through everything he was going to do to fix my problem very respectful very courteous very kind young man I would recommend him to anybody he knows his job likes his job and the awesome thing about Christopher James as he works 24 /7 he will never tell you no even when he's booked that he cannot make it I have never met anyone else that has come to my home to do any kind of repairs like Christopher James again thank you Yelp for your service
t5ebreTIp_I2Xa1BNYpCDQ	I found (and called) the father, Paul, first.  Per the other reviews, he is slowly retiring ... and booked 2 weeks out.  So I called his son, Christopher.  He came out the next day.  He showed up on time, installed my system in less than 90 minutes, explained everything, tested my water and was on his way.  Very reasonably priced compared to some of the big names.  I highly recommend this guy.
jENyMoami3Ilt4eeUOy0hg	I found Christopher on Yelp and was extremely pleased.  He returned my call quickly and was able to come over within a couple of days.    He fixed what I had messed up on my RO system and politely explained how not to mess it up in the future.  Christopher finished the work quickly and was reasonably priced.  The system has been working perfectly since he did the work a few weeks ago.  I highly recommend Christopher to anyone who needs RO work done.
-LKGrzxILwdnI3BFX4gVqw	Had an issue with my system that I needed fixed fast. After not getting callback from other businesses listed here, I called Chris. He quickly diagnosed my issue, and even though it was late in the day, Chris said he could come over in the morning. After arriving he took the time to explain each part of my system, and promptly had it fixed and working perfectly again - all at a reasonable rate! I will definitely be having Chris maintain my system going forward.
aw5n9Cgosiu8PMAoRsmEXQ	Christopher was referred to me by his father, who also does reverse osmosis. Christopher came and I paid him $100 cash. The system wasn't working when he left, but Christopher assurred me that the tank was filling up, and if I had a problem, he had a 30-day guarantee, and that I could call his father if I needed to reach him. Two days later, water was still not coming out of the faucet. I called Christopher for a week without a call back. I called his father, who said that he contacted him. " He told me about you. He said you're a nice lady. He's going to call you. If he doesn't, call me back," Paul said. I called Paul back, and he became indignant and said that he might be able to get to me a week later. "I'm not doing it because it's my responsibility. You refer people..that doesn't mean it's my responsibility." Now, I'm out of $100, without a working system, and Christopher is still dodging my calls. I wouldn't refer either one of them to anyone.
ubeE1JcAI6zoj8LTquHOlw	I WOULD NEVER USE THIS SERVICE EVER AGAIN. Christopher was referred to my family by his aging father, who had nothing but good things to say about Christopher's work, although Chris himself is not employed by his fathers business and instead does reverse osmosis work as a side job. Chris came out to complete the job, however after he left my system was still not working but he assured us it would soon be ass soon as the tank filled with water. The tank never started to work, so I called Christopher back to complete the work, since he promised a 30 day warranty. Two weeks after the work was done, Christopher has still not returned my over 30 calls requesting service. His father was also no help. Now, two weeks after Christopher's initial work, our reverse osmosis is still not working, and I now have a new leak that may or may not be related to Christopher's work while in my home.
yVHfUix4G9Stfcs92Y6ueQ	I had the EXACT SAME experience as Erica R. and LaVonda R. I could copy and paste their reviews but just read them. I feel scammed
iOHHAyPa4gVRLpe1npOkXA	Amanda is the real deal!  And she's what Lulu's Aesthetics is all about. I've been her client for some time now, and she never disappoints. The location is easy to find, with ample street parking. Amanda uses only the best products and she listens carefully to hear what you want. She wants you to look great AND feel great after she works her magic on you. She listens to what you want and uses that information to deliver the look you're aiming for. Yay, Amanda and Lulu's Aesthetic
_tC6lGWKdsJI8I6oY6nkdA	Amanda is a true expert and amazing at what she does.  I have been getting waxed for over eight years and Amanda by far is one of the BEST! I was fortunate enough to find her over a year ago and I will follow her wherever she goes!      Her service is the epitome of customer-centered.  Her location is easy to find, parking is ample, and she works with her clients' schedules to always be available.  She places her clients at ease during treatments and does not push products like I have found so many others do.  I would recommend her highly for wax and skin care services - in fact I have!!  Her work is always perfect and near painless when is comes to waxing. :)  She the best around!
VgedDOqrRIovaU3ODsO2YQ	Seriously love This girl!!!! She does wonders for eyebrows! Go see her! I have had such a problem with getting my eyebrows to the right shape.  After visiting Amanda the 1st time they looked fabulous. Now they are so perfect I get so many compliments!
whxI9K6zTCcwzDzvFRywoA	Amanda is the best, period.  She knows what she is doing and my eyebrows have never looked better.  She is affordable, knowledgeable, friendly, and a perfectionist. She has a true passion for what she does.  You will not be disappointed.  I have stopped the search of the perfect esthetician, as I have found her.
rkLtKsZZIuw2NmCduVD8CA	I have had the same person do my brows for years and was beyond nervous to try someone new..but I am beyond happy that I did! Amanda is amazing and does such a great job. Every time I leave I feel like my face is completely transformed and I feel great. She is my go to girl and I would highly recommend her for all waxing and aesthetic needs. She's not only a highly talented professional but is very accommodating and really provides optimal customer service. I was in a jam and about to go on a trip and she made it work; I couldn't be more grateful.
pnxEFlSVG1MiAOjBvBvrrQ	I did it. Committed the over tweezed eyebrow crime. I have been a client of Amanda's for about a year now - but not for brows. There was no hesitation. Once I realized the error of my ways, I immediately called Amanda! Was able to seamlessly book an appointment and am happy to report I am on my way to brow recovery!   I've also been in to see her for the oxygen facial - which was an amazing experience. She has passion for her career, superior product knowledge, and pride in her work. Not to mention a positive attitude and just simply a pleasure to be around.   Thank you Amanda!
75EujF48dw4hERZOAL-oMg	Amanda is the eyebrow whisperer!  My brows have never looked better.  They are fuller and people have described them at "killer".  She is super flexible with her schedule and pricing is great!  Definitely go see her!!
zPBpmeLUqh00pY6eZRDLIg	Amanda is fantastic!  I came to her after having years of "chop shop" waxing on my brows. She has completely transformed them, they looks so good now!  I would highly recommend her for brows, Brazil's and facials!  She's a true artist!
Ss8IKLTgoZ5I9-FvNW0n6Q	Amanda does fantastic work! She is amazing with brows and does quick and easy brazilians. Her facials are so relaxing and she has a great touch. She uses Luzern, which I love and are superior products. I look forward to seeing her again soon!
4_DA1Qpx8kgWbPA9Ne7t4w	I have never gotten my eyebrows done before because I have such light blonde hair and I didn't want them to be too over done/ unnatural /dramatic, but I am absolutely in love with Amanda's services (brow tint and wax) and would HIGHLY recommend her!! She really listens to what you want and is a perfectionist! Very professional and extremely affordable! Love love love the results and can't wait to go back!
4Fweibg8PUzvLrS2J1eb5w	I've been seeing Amanda for over a year and will not go to anyone else for waxing.  Amanda is very thorough and will get every last bit of hair off.  She will go above and beyond to get me in for last minute services!  Amanda is affordable, personable, knowledgeable and friendly.  I would highly recommend seeing her for waxing and/or skin care!
-0xL-74r_iKqe1VREo_dsQ	Amanda was Awesome. Super professional, explained everything she was using and what it did for my face! She also waxed my brows and did an incredible job. 5 stars! She was gentle, soothing and comfortable! Even gave me samples to take home. :)
FW569y0sZUDCKOYJvrVraQ	They say your eyebrows should look like sisters, not twins.  Well, before I found Amanda, my brows looked like anorexic neighbors. The little lady at the chop shop I had been visiting was slowly making my brows thinner and more misshapen each time. Amanda helped me get them back to their proper size while still keeping them presentable during regrowth. I won't let anyone else near my brows anymore and I would drive however far for Amanda's magic touch.  I'm so excited to try her new facials and let her put her perfectionism and attention to detail to work on my skin!  Did I mention that she's incredibly sweet too?  Seriously, people, what are you waiting for?  Let her get your brows in sisterly shape today!
j-S-YddR8RlBbWRenYnmPA	I'll keep this simple about the facial I got::::  -Attention to my needs.  -Amazing knowledge of appro product for my crazy skin.  -great overall facial!!!!   I can't wait to come back and get another. I'm really impressed with the products they carry as well. I have nothing but great things to say about this place! I will be returning for a wax! :)
_gpEZvPYZ6Pk7RtnxPT6Pw	My friend recommended Amanda to me and I couldn't be more pleased!! She did such an AMAZING job on my eyebrows. Never have they looked better I am feeling like a Million Bucks ;)  I already scheduled my next appointment with her AND  plan on getting a Facial as well. It doesn't get any better then this!
sSGy3k-5afDIk7sYgKEjsg	I've been going to Amanda for brow waxing for over a year now and refuse to let anyone else touch them. She's extremely detailed and has done an amazing job each time. I've recommended friends to her and would highly recommend again. She's the best of the best!
nS9tPPBBuZ_9z-XrjjldcQ	I've been seeing Amanda for around a year and cannot stress the exceptional service Amanda provides!  She goes above and beyond every time, which I appreciate as a Lulu's regular.  From a brow wax to a Brazilian, she makes these not-so-pleasant experiences incredibly bearable.  There's a reason her clients are so loyal...!!
DuyZSAy4FG7JuYvpHmL0ww	I've never had anyone make me feel like such a VIP! Amanda is not only the most talented esthetician I've ever been to, but by far the most personable.  She is the only one I trust for my brows and Brazilian, and she is definitely the most thorough.   You will get the best value and service with Amanda, and I would recommend her to anyone! She even does late night appointments based on MY availability! You won't find customer service like that anywhere else.
gg-vJ3VmpGS3sNcn8xS0hw	First time here and I'm already a big fan! Amanda kept my brows the thickness they need to be and not so thin you can't tell u have a brow! Needless to say.. I will definitely be back.
71ouJNcvzyfqlOuYBCG74Q	Amanda saved my eyebrows! I had the genius idea to get my eyebrows done at the airport (bad bad idea) and they completely messed up my arch and my brows were so thin and odd looking. I read Amanda's glowing reviews and immediately set up an appointment for a week and a half after, to give my eyebrows time to grow out a little. I didn't think it would be possible to fix my eyebrows in one visit but she did the impossible. My eyebrows looked like they belonged on my face again. The majority of eyebrow waxers don't understand or listen when I ask them to not wax my brows too thin. Finally! Someone who understands thicker brows!   Amanda is awesome as well. Everything is very comfortable and she's easy to talk to. Even though I had just met her, I felt like I was talking to an old friend. She's very meticulous and has an eye for brows. As soon as my car is out of the shop, this will be my go-to place! I don't trust anyone else! My lip wax was a breeze too and no irritation (even though I have sensitive, acne prone skin) and she left me completely smooth. Will be back!!
ZqOl5sB_vk4eHGPHccOeaA	I can absolutely say that Amanda is the best at what she does. I have some brows that always need taming and she has consistently waxed and shaped them beautifully!
6Whcp3gZoeZ5pGCIEtvvhQ	I have been going to Amanda since she was at Canyon Ranch in Tucson. Naturally, once I moved up here, I continued to see her. She is such a fantastic woman. She's always so warm and welcoming. Our visits are honestly fun! I've seen her for an array of things- waxing and facials. She has so much knowledge to provide, even about things I never knew! She's been thoroughly educational about my beauty needs. My eye brows are now full thanks to her showing me the wonders of Rapid Lash. I'm always waxed to the finest precision. OMG and her facials?!?! INCREDIBLE!!! I recommend her to everyone and I hope everyone gets the pleasure of her incredible expertise and her amazing personality!
lC5H7gYYEsiVJn5E6HNQIg	I was referred to Amanda by a friend and she is just fantastic!!! She does an excellent job, I wouldn't dream of going anywhere else! I drive 35 miles to come to her!!!! Not to mention she's fun to be around and mallets you feel totally comfortable!
wHqNiKB_5xX1XxwcvI188A	I just recently moved back from NYC and was faithful to my threading but I read so many amazing reviews for Amanda on here and I was more than thrilled after leaving! Her specialty is keeping your brows full and beautiful and she does it very well. I have never had someone as attentive as her work on my brows. She is definitely a perfectionist!   Amanda also has a wealth of knowledge regarding skin as well! I had 1 million and 1 questions about brows, skincare and who knows what else. She makes you feel extremely comfortable and safe the entire time. So no need to fear walking out with half an eyebrow!   I left feeling like I gained a new friend and will definitely be giving her my business as long as I'm in Arizona!
4U5K3gPPUCYKkOeidR_nMQ	Amanda is the best!  I get all my hair removed from her!  She's amazing at Brazilians!  I wouldn't go anywhere else (well, one day I did and I'll never do it again!).  She is so meticulous and detailed with the Brazilian, eyebrows, everything!
YW3h4Rr23yDNCzrlN84sbA	Was searching for someone to do my eyebrows after many horrible experiences, I found Amanda and she is honestly the sweetest thing. I have been seeing her for a few months now and my brows have never looked better. My whole family is now seeing her and we couldn't be happier.  I will not see anyone else and now my next appointment will be for a facial as well, she's very knowledgeable !
X-Hh2LeR2sYrPkr4nz49tg	I am from PA and this was a last minute thing! I never ever leave reviews but this place just deserves one! Amanda is just great! the place is gorgeous! affordable! online booking ON POINT! my eyebrows and I will be forever grateful!
nBxaifEnbOA16sO1CM1-Zg	I've been extremely pleased with the services provided every time I've visited. From the moment you walk in to the moment you step out the door, customer satisfaction is the highest priority.  Always being greeted with a smile and dealing with a consummate professional keeps me coming back.   I have received multiple waxing services and have been 100% satisfied every time. Even though I thought I did a pretty good job myself with my eyebrows, I have been shown the actual way to shape and form a unibrow!   Another characteristic I really appreciate is Amanda's ability to convey knowledge about her services and skin care products. I am one to always ask questions and she has the right answer every time and if she doesn't, she won't hesitate to admit it and find the answer for me.    If you are ever in need of aesthetic services and products, Amanda Waters should be number one on your list to take care of your every need. She does an amazing job!
5ezmBclHt2nYvu_DTc5SqQ	Amanda was really great. She took her time to make sure my eyebrows came out perfect. Will definitely go to her for my eyebrows from now on.
1r4A7VRj_uFGfvcCOjmg2g	I'll start off by saying I will never see anyone else but Amanda to do my eyebrows!   I was never one to get my eyebrows waxed because I have sensitive skin, so I swore it off.  With a wedding/honeymoon coming up soon in May 2015, I decided to search for options to get my eyebrows taken care of; tweezing was not making me feel absolutely confident.  I knew that there had to be someone out there that could help me make them look clean and well-groomed!  I came across a review on here that said they were also sensitive to wax and when they used Amanda's services, they pretty much had no reaction.  Being sold on her 5-star review and that comment, I immediately booked an appointment.  Upon arrival, I was greeted so kindly and warmly and she made me feel right at home.  As she started waxing my eyebrows, she was incredibly easy going and great to talk to throughout the appointment.  I have to say that I could have easily fallen asleep, it was so therapeutic!    I had told her that I had wanted to grow my eyebrows out more; make them a little more natural looking and she offered tips on how to accomplish that.  She is very knowledgeable and never once pushed/forced any product on me to buy; just offered advice.  After all was done, her work far exceeded my expectations and it felt amazing!  I barely had any sight of redness or bumps around my eyebrows and that made me ecstatic.  She has made a customer for life and I will not trust anyone else!   Thank you Amanda, you are awesome!
sN_C53eIZN9qfFNvaIUSRA	I have been going to Amanda for a few years for my brows. She is the only aesthetician who understands my obsession for full, symmetrical brows. She is a true perfectionist in the best possible way.  Did I mention that she is delightful as well? Always courteous and responsive, not to mention funny and sweet. Getting a wax or facial with her is like hanging out with an old friend! You won't be disappointed if you give her a try.
MEdl0zCLPpk7W8drgIewLQ	Amanda made me beautiful for my birthday. Tinted and waxed my brows. I'm grateful I found someone who knows how to do brows properly!
j3OVQ4QolLSPWUdT2qU0UQ	Amanda is AMAZING!  My brows can quickly get out of control if I don't maintain them, and Amanda is the absolute best at making sure they're groomed and look good. She takes into consideration the shape of my face, which is a big deal to me, and has great attention to detail. Plus, she's super sweet and funny. I'd actually gone to her when she was at a different place, and when she left, I quit going there because none of the other aestheticians could match her work! I was absolutely thrilled when I tracked her down (in a non-creepy way) and will never go to anyone else. She's that awesome!
u1k_zPyOUmeYzxH35JvJ8g	AMANDA IS AWESOME made my eyebrow alive again yuppp alive... Highly recommend...I have semi eyebrow tattoo and it was fading away and she fix it for me...I'm so happy I found her.... will come back....
2VS0LXdW62HBm1T9IcM15Q	My brows were a mess thanks to a quick job done at a pedicure place. Amanda skillfully fixed them for me and even showed me how to use a brow pencil to fill in! She really took her time and did a wonderful job. Additionally, her prices are very reasonable! From now on, I will only go here!
ilwkMAiQoglfBCSnQ3Iq5w	Amanda was absolutely amazing! This was my first time getting my eyebrows waxed, so I was very careful to read as many reviews as possible to choose the right person for the job. Lulu's Aesthetics had great reviews and showcased pictures of their work (fantastic, natural-looking brows!), so it wasnt long before I was in their comfy spa chair/bed. The whole experience was very relaxing and virtually painless! I was expecting it to be extremely painful, as I've heard waxing usually is. But the wax and the unique way Amanda waxes and tweezes the brow hairs was painless and actually quite calming. Amanda herself is very sweet and made the first-time-wax experience less nerve-racking. My brows turned out fantastic! Natural-looking, thicker and more cleanly structured than my brows have ever looked before. My brows actually looked like they belonged on my face!  I enjoyed my experience and brows so much that I tipped Amanda $40! That should tell you how wonderful she is at her job and who your next brow (or other hair removal, facial or makeup needs) appointment should be made with!
6BJlZO8aV-ichkGj8L4DQg	Amanda's work is magical! She can work wonders on my brows and have them looking better than I could even imagine! Will no longer trust anyone else with my brows!
F4Me9DYNvetAHmighCIYsQ	15 years ago, thin was in. Little did I know I was destroying my brows. Not only has Amanda motivated me and encouraged me to grow my brows out, she's found their original shape and has maintained it! I refuse to allow anyone else tell me about skin care or overall beauty care. Amanda uses Luzern which is so exclusive, only a few resorts are authorized to use/sell it- and she was granted special authorization to use and retail it... I did my research. Jennifer Aniston, Emma Watson, the Houstons... Many high profile people use Luzern. It's crazy that I'm able to get this product steps away from my front door! Not only are her products sensitive to my breakout prone skin, she's so gentle and her technique is efficient and the best I've ever experienced. Parking is easy, and the salon itself is a gem! I'm so thankful, grateful, and gracious I found this amazing woman that can make me feel just as amazing!
mRkM31gTWiGshT4FR_OFNQ	I recently moved to the area for college and needed someone trust worthy to wax my eyebrows. I was so happy when I decided to give Amanda a try. she not only makes my eyebrows look great but she brightens my day! I look forward to my next appointment, where as they are always so relaxing and make me feel so pampered. highly highly recommend!
zRFK8VJ57RG0UxG2BQFQRw	Honestly very happy my sister found this place for me after I missed my appt at my normal place.  Amanda was amazing and knew exactly what I wanted to do to my eyebrows without saying a word and after this visit I can say I have a new place to get my eyebrows done. Definitely recommend coming here...great prices and wonderful owner!!!
CWb2-aPgk06d7s0giW0t3Q	Jesus beyond blessed Amanda's hands!!! She is AMAZING!!!!! I have been to every kind of shop there is, Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Latino (wax & thread)  and no one has ever paid attention as to what I always asked for (full brows) and without question Amanda hit the nail on the head! I absolutely love my new brow shape and brow tint!! After letting them grow for 3months she beyond exceeded my expectations making the wait and growth worth while! The most painless experience I've ever had with any kind of wax. She is super sweet and personable! Her shop is super easy to find, very clean and mellow environment. I can't wait to go back for other services & would most definitely recommend to any and everyone! She's the best!
tYxGzJuvkkVvk61QLip08A	So far I've had one appointment for my eyebrows and will be going back. I am trying to grow them. She shaped them perfect for what she is working with and understands what I'm trying to do to shape them best for my face. I've struggled with other places where they do well for a while then out of no where take off waaaay more than they should and BAM I'm back to the 90s with pencil thin, nearly nonexistent brows. And by then it's too late- not like you can glue the hair back on.... I've also started using rapidlash to help in the process. I'll post before/after pics in a few months once I see more progress.
Bse3eNQEQDb0w7Tng2KFVw	Amanda at Lulu's completely changed my face and confidence for the better. I had the pleasure of being referred to Amanda about a year and a half ago, after a lady at one of those brow threading places in the mall threaded off more than half my natural brow. I didn't know if they would ever come back. Amanda was just as horrified as I was when she saw my brows, but assured me that she would get them back for me. With Amanda's amazing technique and amazing products, my brows are now more full, shaped, and beautiful than they have ever been. After I experienced what Amanda could do with my brows, I started trying her facials and amazing Luzern facial products. I have never had a better facial in my life! I had her oxygen infused microdermabrasion facial and it was like having a face transplant. I'm moving to Southern California, and unfortunately, will not get to pop in and see Amanda as much as I want to, but you better believe I will every time I'm back in town. With everything she's done for me and with what a beautiful and amazing friend she has become, I just had to share my experience with her on here for everyone to see!
-MzfTwwxvva36tTglIfR5w	I just got back from visiting Amanda at Lulu's and I can finally breathe! I just moved to Phoenix and was loyal to one person prior to my move - when it came to my brows. I have spent 4 months with big bushy eyebrows hoping to find the right place.   Amanda is friendly, easy to talk to, experienced, and so talented! My big bushy eyebrows now have the shape I want without thinning them out dramatically.   I have found my place!
yQ2F5_OzVSTSniiZHtlI9Q	It was my first time going to Lulu's Aesthetics and I absolutely loved the service! Amanda is very personable and efficient. The space itself is beautiful, clean, and calming. She did a great job with eyebrow waxing and I will be back again.
Qp2CXNzuDmdwPSjcVHFfgg	Amanda did such a wonderful job on my eyebrows! I was nervous getting them done for the first time and she was so knowledgable and thorough! Treatment room was beautiful and clean! I would recommend her to anyone and everyone!!!
Y98VhtyZwWRB8bcsJyOo7g	Dr. Mora is AMAZING and really knows her stuff! I have been receiving prolozone therapy on my wrist after a ligament injury 6 months ago. I highly recommend The Anti- Aging Spot for any sports injury! Beautiful office, great knowledgeable staff and convenient location!
m2JxZmKLqjQqX0GveejvGA	I love this place because of the atmosphere and the the location. Dr Melanie Rose Icard is always so positive and very knowledgeable. My favorite therapies are vitamin IVs, acupuncture, bio modulator and Ozone spa. Great experience every time.
Av8nmo4RU3yxlqVDEZUA4w	I love this place! The doctors really know what they are doing. I adore the ozone sauna and seeing the results from expelled toxins. Everyone is always so nice! Highly recommended.
oYzqebAGPQRTo6hiEUwKTw	I wanted to thank two young Naturopathic Doctors for what they do and for taking such good care of me!

5tjyafWEqxE2ldb3Ufg2mA	Had some time to kill before a morning customer meeting and needed some caffeine. Found this place on Yelp and glad I did. It hit the spot. Quaint local coffee house with the regular offerings and it looked like a few other choices as well. I stuck with a caramel macchiato no whip, 16oz and it was  just what I needed. Not too sweet, hot and the coffee was flavorful. The caramel didn't overpower it. Give it a try some morning.
Wos7tKNbM8WeSHvVG_GBZA	Great customer service. Excellent coffee. Relaxing atmosphere. Free WiFi. Its close to home and I enjoy coming here in the mornings. Prices are very reasonable. You can also purchase coffee to brew at home; I have not yet but will soon, since I own a keurig.
XGZN8sIg_SrGmw-oCBlcAg	I visited this cafe this morning & was greeted by the owner first thing, which gives a very welcoming feeling.  The service was excellent & the atmosphere was very friendly.  I was impressed by the POS system to pay for my tea & croissant, which I enjoyed very much.  This is a great place to meet friends, new & old and a great place to relax.
41oLZnEqf8ERVinBXiWgpw	Great coffee!  The staff is always friendly. Lovely place. House blend is always good. Speciality blends are fun to try.
I28ipI53vpfF759UbujQCg	This is my new  go to spot for java.  Very friendly, relaxing atmosphere, and the caramel macchiatto that I had was amazing!  I also had the pecan bar, and I'm not exaggerating when I say it was crazy good!!  If you are in for a chewy, nutty, buttery treat, I'd highly recommend this one.  The service was excellent.  This is a great place to sit and chat with friends, or, like in my case,  to work.  They provide free WiFi and power hookups if needed.
URYY7X7seJBDgJjYCcsH7w	I loved this place before it became Coppa, and it is still just as awesome.  Great coffee made exceptionally well. Their sweets are awesome too.
PUhIdmTC8cjauuDjKM8Fmw	The staff here are incredibly friendly and are genuine in their attempt to make sure the customer is happy. It was one of the staff member's first time doing a pour-over and she was genuinely concerned about the quality of my drink because she wanted to make sure she got it right and she got it right. I like how you can pick your beans for the pour-over from a selection of 20 or so glass jars. Definitely something for everyone as was the selection of brewed coffees in carafes. I counted 5 on this day.   Seating here is fairly abundant with lots of window views. Piped in music was unique, but not overbearing. Plenty of parking too.   One gripe though. The apple cream cheese muffin I got and the blueberry muffin my friend got was definitely either from Costco or BJ's. Had an overbearing packaged taste to it and was not good at all. I had to keep taking big gulps of coffee to saturate the taste. I also didn't like that the bagels were packaged in Ziploc bags. Not attractive at all! I'm guessing they were also from Costco or BJ's.   I'd come back if I were in the area and needed some coffee, but not a "special trip" kind of place.
GHs4WJdNG67q8i4DAAwlhg	Love this little spot! Greeted immediately upon entering with "good morning!" and smiles from the 2 young employees at the counter. I wanted something sweet and they cheerfully helped me select something from their menu. I got the Caramel Macchiato as recommended by another Yelper and it did not disappoint. Hot, sweet and hit the spot! The decor is cozy with smooth jazz playing, several tables to sit at and a comfy leather sofa up front. I stuck around to drink my coffee and lounge on that comfy sofa. :-) I just wish this place was a destination I pass more often but I might reconfigure my route to make sure I drive by!
q2NKFhA7jlb-K8KUuL2fuw	Nice quiet place outskirts of Charlotte. Staff is always very friendly. Coffee brew is nice - nothing bitter, and prices are reasonable.
7Ikk5Oi4A-o4WHkwqgy4pg	Coppa Coffee is a fabulous little coffee shop that I discovered while running errands. I had seen it before but decided to stop in.  I am a Starbucks addict. I don't like anything else that I try. Coppa has a coffee drink called White Moose and that is what I tried the day I stopped in.  I have to say that exceeded my expectations to the point where I will say (& I can't believe I'm saying this) IT IS BETTER THAN STARBUCKS! If I wasn't trying to wean myself off of coffee right now I'd be there everyday.  Besides the coffee being good, the staff is friendly and I've seen the same faces so I think they have a nice following.  The negative... I stopped in for an ice cream date with my daughter because they advertise Tony's Ice Cream. We are originally from Gastonia where the original Tony's ice cream is so we are familiar with its goodness. This is where I was dissappointed. The young lady (in training) who made the ice cream cones confirmed with the owner if she had enough on the cones which he said "that's good". There was such a small amount of ice cream on the cone. At the actual Tony's Ice Cream you get 8-10 more on the cone (that's not an exaggeration) than what I received at Coppa and I believe I paid more than what Tony's charges.  I will actually drive back to gastonia for ice cream if I get a craving before purchasing it at Coppa. So, great coffee just don't get the ice cream unless you only want 1 tiny scoop thus I give it a 4 out of 5!
qoKjhrEsCQmU18p3Ea-1xQ	Great little coffee shop across from the Mt. Island Lake shopping center. I've been here a few times - they have a few tables and a nice couch/sitting area. It's a narrow coffee shop but utilizes space well. They have a wide variety of coffees, teas, and alternatives - they also have a bunch of flavor shots (sugar free too), and flavored coffee beans you can buy to grind yourself. The ice cubes they give for the iced coffee are huge and they are made of frozen coffee beans! The coffee itself is decent - better than average. I haven't tried any of the food or baked goods, but nice that they have a little bit of a selection. The employees are very friendly as well. .50 for small refills, .75 for medium refills
aK_f39mdTl5UvRpx5Ho3jA	The employees are extremely friendly. They greet you as you walk in the door, and speak to you as you're leaving. Coffee is excellent! Way better than the coffee shop that used to be in its place. I got a mocha that was probably the best I've ever had. Can't wait to go back and check out their other offerings, as well as the teas.
8r0SaK9U_8OevhQZzyU2VQ	For a local coffee shop I'd expect a stellar experience especially with the dreaded green mermaid across the street in the grocery store. We ordered 4 specialtiy drinks and an ok chocolate muffin. The espresso based drinks just aren't to my liking. The roast tastes like a medium roast and isn't as dark as I'd like. In my book an espresso should be made with a dark roast but thats just me. Or maybe its the bean they use that I don't particularly like? In either case I'm not a fan.  The chocolate muffin was so-so... And sadly that means I will not be back. It stinks because I love the atmosphere in this skinny little coffee shot. Oh well off to my next java joint!
awMeLs84zwes4YVlNXfDZQ	So I purchased a car from them in Feb. and I already have had to make over $1100 in repairs. I am a first time buyer and I feel awful! I would not buy from them again. Buyer beware! I should have done more research I guess but I would not want anyone else to have to go threw what I am right now. I also purchased there extended warranty which is crap. You can never get ahold of them and they have yet to call me back or help with anything. Do not purchase there extended warranty!
61bZRWPp0WeGjwkPd5D8Vg	I had a really great experience buying a car from here. Tim was great and negotiated a great deal. Once we agreed on a price, the process was quick and I left driving my "new" car. I felt that I was treated well and I would purchase from them again.
