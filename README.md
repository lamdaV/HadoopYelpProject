# Team RAD: Hadoop-Yelp-Project
## Collaborators:
  **R**unzhi Yang, **A**dam Finer, **D**avid Lam

## Feature Goals:
  - [x] Feature 1: We want to reaggregate the businessâ€™s review with an emphasis on the most recent reviews.
  - [x] Feature 2: We want to find the average ratings for all the businesses in each city over a given time interval.
  - [x] Feature 3: We want to find the highest rated business over a given time interval.
  - [x] Feature 4: We want to find a leaderboard of active users within a given time interval.
  - [x] Feature 5: We want, for the above two features, to specify specific features of the types of businesses to be analyzed (like distance from a location, city location, type of business, etc).
  - [x] Feature 6: We want to summarize large reviews with ~~500~~ 1000 characters or more with Sumy python library.
  - [x] Feature 7: We will write a MapReduce job to run a python process to execute Sumy summarizations.
  - [x] Feature 8: Create dynamic rating for business every time it is reviewed, and the rating declines every month. Then plot the business rating over a period of time using zeppelin notebook.

## Milestone:
### Milestone 01:

  - David:
    - [x] Research and write pig scripts that communicate with ~~HBase~~ Hive.
  - All:
    - [x] Discuss how to accomplish aggregate scoring once data is in cluster.

### Milestone 02:
  - Runzhi:
    - [x] Begin working with Hive reaggregation of review score.
    - [ ] ~~Partition Tables properly.~~ (Moved to next Milestone due to bug encountered)
  - Adam:
    - [x] Begin working on feature 2: find the average ratings for all the businesses in each city over a given time interval.
  - David:
    - **Proposed:**
      - [x] Begin working with Hive data to reaggregate review score with weightings.
    - **Extras:**
      - [x] Reworked logistics of review score reaggregation.
      - [x] Finished UDF for Hive review score reaggregation
      - [x] Updated Pig Scripts to remove rows with any null.

### Milestone 03:
   - Runzhi:
     - [x] Start feature 4: We want to find a leaderboard of active users within a given time interval.
     - [x] Partition Tables properly.
   - Adam:
     - [x] Finish feature 2: find the average ratings for all the businesses in each city over a given time interval.
     - [x] Start feature 3: We want to find the highest rated business over a given time interval.
   - David:
     - **Proposed:**
       - [x] Investigate Geo-fencing for Feature 5: We want, for the above two features, to specify specific features of the types of businesses to be analyzed (like distance from a location, city location, type of business, etc).
       - [x] Start on feature 6: We want to summarize large reviews with ~~500~~ 1000 characters or more with Sumy python library.
     - **Extras:**
       - [x] Complete feature 6: We want to summarize large reviews with ~~500~~ 1000 characters or more with Sumy python library.
       - [x] Complete feature 7: We will write a MapReduce job to run a python process to execute Sumy summarizations.

### Milestone 04:
  - Runzhi:
    - [x] Partition the reviews table base on month and year.
    - [x] New feature: add points for business every time it is reviewed, and the points declines every day.
  - Adam:
    - [x] Select business over a time interval, and plot its points chart.
    - [x] Start on feature 5: We want, for the above two features, to specify specific features of the types of businesses to be analyzed (like distance from a location, city location, type of business, etc).
  - David:
    - [x] Determine where to export data (Hive MYSQL, Heroku Postgres, etc.)
    - [x] Start writing sqoop scripts to output to some database
    
### Milestone 05:
   - Runzhi, Adam, David:
    - [ ] Play with oozie, and see how it can work in our project.
