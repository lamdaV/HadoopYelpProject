# Team RAD: Hadoop-Yelp-Project
## Collaborators:
  **R**unzhi Yang, **A**dam Finer, **D**avid Lam

## Feature Goals:
  - [ ] We want to reaggregate the businessâ€™s review with an emphasis on the most recent reviews.
  - [ ] We want to find the average ratings for all the businesses in each city over a given time interval.
  - [ ] We want to find the highest rated business over a given time interval.
  - [ ] We want to find a leaderboard of active users within a given time interval.
  - [ ] We want, for the above two features, to specify specific features of the types of businesses to be analyzed (like distance from a location, city location, type of business, etc).
  - [ ] We will use Pig to write specific queries in which the data is refined and limited to specific details.
  - [ ] We want to summarize large reviews with 500 characters or more with Sumy python library.
  - [ ] We will write a MapReduce job to run a python process to execute Sumy summarizations.
